## For Collaborators 
- Feel free to create your version of this repo by creating a new branch with your name and what you plan to do, e.g. haoze/multi-files
- Don't directly make any changes on the main branch, this is the "stable" branch for deployment.
- One more thing, you may need an openai gpt api key to get the response from them. If you only work on UI and front end, you might not need this.

## Run
1. Install the packages from `requirements.txt`.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. (Optional) The `requirments.txt` might be out of date. Install the package prompted from the terminal.
3. Start the server.
```
python app.py
```  
4. Open a browser, the default page could be `http://localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000`

## Version Update 2024/4/22
- Supports loading indicator when waiting for a response from openai gpt backend.
