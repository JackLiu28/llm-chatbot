IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty Welcome to IMPACT IMPACT is a faculty development program that supports many different models of participation and faculty from all disciplines university-wide. Launched by the Office of the Provost in 2011 and named as a component of the Purdue Moves initiatives by the Office of the President in 2013, IMPACT is a large, collaborative initiative on the Purdue West Lafayette campus. The IMPACT program is guided by the theoretical framework Self-Determination Theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Ryan & Deci, 2017), which is a motivational theory that posits the existence of three basic psychological needs, which when fulfilled, contribute to the creation of a student-centered, autonomy-supportive learning environment. The creation of a student-centered, autonomy-supportive learning environment fosters student engagement and student competence, and increased attainment of course-specific learning outcomes, degree completion, retention, and graduation rates. Our Mission IMPACT supports instructors in enhancing their pedagogical practices in order to create autonomy-supportive and inclusive learning environments to foster student success. Specifically, the IMPACT program aims to support faculty\u2019s ability to: Implement pedagogical practices that are student-centered, autonomy-supportive, and engaging Create learning environments that are equitable and inclusive Adopt a scholarly approach to instruction and contribute to a community of practice Versions of the Program There are three versions of IMPACT in which instructors can participate: IMPACT Week A fully remote experience with one week of facilitated daily drop-in discussions and written feedback. Instructors cover the key components of IMPACT, distilled down into five core Brightspace modules. This is a great option for those who want an introduction to IMPACT, those who want a refresher after having done another IMPACT program, or those wanting an outside review of their course before teaching. This option is open to any instructor of record at Purdue WL and comes with a $1,000 incentive to support their teaching. IMPACT Semester The full, 13-week, \u201csignature program\u201d where instructors work in groups of 3-4 instructors and 2-3 support team members from the Center for Instructional Excellence, Libraries, and Purdue Online. Participants apply with a course they are teaching and choose their own unique redesign goal to work toward throughout the semester. The end deliverable is a Course Design Plan that shows instructors\u2019 plans for their course learning outcomes, objectives, assessments, and activities. This option is open to instructors of record who are faculty or staff at Purdue WL and comes with a $10,000 incentive to support their teaching. IMPACT Month An on-demand, hybrid option that can be tailored to specific initiatives. This 4-week program offers core IMPACT content via Brightspace and involves synchronous sessions where instructors discuss and engage in activities related to that week\u2019s topic as a cohort. Departments or groups of instructors can request this offering by emailing impact@purdue.edu .

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty College Teaching Development Program This program is open to all Purdue West Lafayette, Purdue in Indianapolis, and Purdue Polytechnic Statewide faculty, staff, post docs, and graduate students. We define teaching broadly (classes, mentoring, advising, etc.), and have designed these programs to meet varied goals. The program is offered by the Center for Instructional Excellence (CIE) and consists of two tracks: The Certificate of Foundations in College Teaching The Certificate of Practice in College Teaching \u2014 Under review; not offered Fall 2024 The tracks are both standalone and can be completed in any order. The Practice Certificate can also be completed multiple times with different emphases. Below are descriptions, as well as the requirements to complete each certificate Certificate of Foundations in College Teaching The Foundations Certificate provides an overview of central topics in college teaching. This program has an online, asynchronous structure. It is open to all Purdue West Lafayette, Purdue in Indianapolis, and Purdue Polytechnic Statewide faculty, staff, post docs, and graduate students. We define teaching broadly (classes, mentoring, advising, etc.), and have designed the program to meet varied goals. The structure of this program consists of four main modules: Reflecting on Teaching & Learning, Defining and Assessing Student Learning, Creating a Learner-Centered Environment, and Becoming a Scholarly Teacher . This program is designed to be cohort-based and is dependent upon participant engagement on discussion board threads as participants bring important knowledge and experience to this environment. Many past participants have found engaging with other instructors to be the most valuable part of this program.\u00a0For more information on program details, read the Foundations Syllabus . During Foundations, you will work toward the following goals: Recognize and reflect upon your own values related to teaching and learning. Recognize and describe the value of evidence-based approaches to teaching that facilitate student learning. Build community and discuss evidence-based teaching approaches with fellow participants. Consider implications of evidence-based approaches for your own teaching practices. Identify what else you want to know and resources to continue expanding your teaching knowledge\u00a0and practices. What a typical week will look like: Engage with content in each unit module. Share a short reflection in a small discussion group. Optional: Join facilitators for weekly Office Hour Discussions. Registration Information: The six-week, online program is delivered in a 100 percent asynchronous format. The Fall 2024 session runs Mon., Sept 9, through Fri., Oct 18. Participants should plan to devote approximately three hours during each week of the program. Register here by Fri., Aug. 23. We are able to accept the first 50 registrants. We will have a waitlist once we reach that capacity. If you are unsure whether you will have availability to participate fully in the program, please defer to a semester you are able to participate; we offer this program each semester (Fall/Spring). Register Now Certificate of Practice in College Teaching We are taking time to reflect and revise the Certificate of Practice Program, so it will not be offered Fall 2024. In the meantime, we suggest you visit the Scholarship of Teaching & Learning page on Teaching@Purdue to learn more about and explore inquiry-based practices to address challenges/opportunities in your teaching. The Certificate of Practice is an inquiry-based, semester-long program that requires participants have a teaching role, broadly defined, during the semester or summer term in which they complete the certificate. Participants identify a challenge/opportunity that they will address that semester using evidence-based practices, in consultation with an appropriate mentor of their choosing. Participants are encouraged to choose topics relevant to their specific teaching role; this can involve new mentoring practices in advising, a lab, or office hours; designing new assessments or learning activities; or enhancing a series of professional development workshops for colleagues. Participants may complete the Certificate of Practice multiple times over different semesters, as long as they have a teaching role during that semester. Each time a participant completes the certificate, they must choose a different area of emphasis (e.g., engagement, student motivation, assessment, diversity and inclusion, and mentoring students.)

Session 1: Exploring teaching, learning opportunities in Purdue\u2019s Strategic Initiatives Thurs., Aug. 22, 1-2 p.m. Session recording During TLCoP\u2019s first session for Fall 2024, we discussed what Purdue\u2019s strategic initiatives might mean in our courses and for Purdue\u2019s teaching community. For example: TLCoP now includes Purdue faculty who are teaching in Indianapolis. What might this mean for students, courses, and/or facilities across our newly extended campus? How might we redefine our teaching-and-learning community? How can we engage and collaborate in this expanded environment? This initial session is also designed to identify and prioritize other strategic initiatives that TLCoP will explore in its monthly sessions. Some examples might be: Ways to leverage technology for teaching and learning. Opportunities to enhance student learning beyond a physical classroom. Strategies to provide accessibility and foster belonging in a variety of learning environments. Collaboration and interdisciplinary approaches to teaching and learning. Integrating research and teaching. Recordings of past TLCoP sessions Join our teaching & learning community TLCoP meetings offer the unique opportunity to come together in an ongoing, flexible, and supportive environment to engage in conversation about a range of teaching and learning issues . In conversation with others from across a range of disciplines, at various stages in their academic careers, and with different kinds of experiences in the classroom, participants collectively explore pedagogical ideas and strategies that they can incorporate into their courses. As a community of practice, TLCoP is open to any instructors who wish to learn more about teaching and learning and to those who wish to share their experiences with others. Graduate students, faculty, instructional support staff, or anyone who is passionate about teaching is welcome to attend any and all meetings. We\u2019re thrilled to have you and to learn from one another! TLCoP is an initiative of Purdue\u2019s Innovative Learning Team , including the Center for Instructional Excellence, Purdue University Libraries and School of Information Studies, and Purdue University Online. Staff members from each of these teams make up the planning committee and lend expertise in pedagogy, educational technologies, information and research support, as well as augmented and virtual reality in the classroom. These committee members are available to advise instructors on additional resources and relevant services related to TLCoP meetings.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty CoPILOT Program Overview Purdue University Online is taking applications for CoPILOT: Cohort Program for Innovation and Leadership in Online Teaching . Purdue West Lafayette instructors of record for online courses may submit an electronic application to join the semester-long, online instructor development program. The program will meet weekly in 60-minute online synchronous sessions. Through the CoPILOT program each participant will: receive assistance from instructional designers and video producers facilitating the program; collaborate with the cohort through discussion and review of course design and facilitation plan with actionable feedback; and obtain a working knowledge of Purdue University Online services. By the end of the program, CoPILOT participants will have a ready-to-teach, accessible online course in Brightspace using research-based online course pedagogy that has been reviewed (enabling it to meet \u201cCourse Ready\u201d as listed in the QM-Correlated Course Design Evaluation Rubric ). Participants will be expected to complete tasks and assignments prior to course meetings and plan for at least 5 hours outside of meeting time work each week. Course development through CoPILOT is fully funded, covering the cost of instructional designers and video producers, a savings of $12,200. Participants in the program will receive a $5,000 stipend for their effort. This stipend will be disbursed in accordance with completion of three course design milestones ($1000 at each milestone) and at the completion of the online course (a final $2000). Instructors will need a WBSE .06 departmental account set up in their name. Funds are to be used to support the CoPILOT instructor and/or the CoPILOT-developed course ($5,000 per completed course). Program Outcomes The goal of CoPILOT is to enable Purdue University instructors to both develop and deliver Best-in-Class (asynchronous, accessible, active-learning) online courses in a scalable, collaborative, and community environment. Specifically, CoPILOT creates cohorts of Purdue faculty in which participants, both individually and collaboratively, enhance their understanding and ability to: develop course outcomes and learning objectives; design assessments and activities aligned to outcomes and objectives, appropriate for online delivery; determine and design course content that incorporates research-based practices for online teaching into course design; familiarize themselves with Purdue University Online functional areas; and identify and determine best practices for online courses delivery. Framework (Purdue) PETE Plan, Execute, Teach, Evaluate. Plan: Design a course in which outcomes, objectives, and course activities are aligned. Execute: Create the course content and activities in the LMS. Teach: Facilitate the course and provide student feedback. Evaluate: Reflect based upon feedback to make course improvements.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty Student Pedagogy Advocates The Student\u00a0Pedagogy\u00a0Advocates program is designed to pair\u00a0students and instructors as partners in support of enhancing teaching and learning at Purdue. The program is sponsored by the Office of the Provost, with funding from a NSF grant, and administered by the Center for Instructional Excellence. Student\u00a0Pedagogy\u00a0Advocates\u00a0serve as catalysts, helping instructors think through potential class structures and activities, observing and reporting back on the class, and supporting communication between instructors and\u00a0students enrolled in the class. This is distinct from the role of teaching assistants, who often support the delivery or assessment of content, as the\u00a0students in this program are present only to focus on\u00a0pedagogy, communication, and the classroom environment. Student\u00a0advocates\u00a0attend class meetings as well as meet with instructors weekly to discuss their observations and offer feedback and input. Instructors and\u00a0student\u00a0advocates\u00a0collaborate with the program director to determine an appropriate focus for their work such as: classroom environment/structure, pedagogical transparency, and classroom conversations.

Online Credit & Non-credit (Professional Development) Graduate Program Launch Process Online Non-Credit Program Launch Process Online Graduate Course Launch Process Online Undergraduate Launch Process Grant Resources State Authorization and How it Affects Your Online Education Purdue University is obligated to comply with other states\u2019 laws regarding the delivery of distance education. For purposes of this summary, distance education includes any traditional, online, and hybrid program or course involving instruction given, in whole or in part, outside the state of Indiana. State laws regarding distance education vary state-by-state, and even program-by-program within a state. Consequently, compliance with state authorization requirements is an ongoing process. Traditional Courses \u2013 Regulations also vary state-by-state with respect to traditional courses that take place outside the state of Indiana (internship, externship, clerkship, practicum, rotation, clinical, independent study, study away, mentoring, advising, proctoring and the like) and may not necessarily be the same regulations regarding online distance education. Residency \u2013 Course and program availability varies by state. Admission into a program is granted at the time of initial acceptance into the program and is dependent on program availability in the state where the student is physically located at the time of admission . If a student moves to a different state after admission to the program, continuation within the program will depend on the availability of the program within the new state where the student is physically present. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to notify the institution of a change in physical presence. Whether military personnel stationed outside the state of Indiana, may enroll or continue in a Purdue University distance education program or not, is based on where military personnel are stationed.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty Teaching & Learning\u00a0Feedback The Center for Instructional Excellence (CIE) offers a number of confidential services on teaching and learning that are designed to make effective use of your time in achieving your goals and your students\u2019 academic success. These services bring pedagogical experts alongside faculty and instructors,\u00a0using evidence-supported reflective practices to examine teaching strategies and foster student-centered learning environments. This may include gathering student perceptions , conducting observation s, and other strategies that are shared in individual consultations . It all begins with you sharing your situation in this short, confidential Qualtrics survey about your instructional goals, courses, and timeframe (at least two weeks\u2019 notice is needed). CIE will contact you within 48 hours after you complete the Qualtrics. Gather student perceptions There are two key points in a semester to gather student perceptions of courses: early and\u00a0end-of-semester. We can help you do either or both.\u00a0These services provide information on what your students are thinking about your course and what suggestions they have for improvement. Early student perception feedback allows you to do two things that are supported by research: 1) make changes to the course early in the semester/session that may help\u00a0current students better achieve course learning outcomes, and 2) have informed conversations about their learning with students. There are several options for early student feedback: Midterm evaluations through Instructional Data Processing (IDP, a division of CIE) during Week 6 of a semester. This survey uses Purdue\u2019s Course Evaluation software , which is also used for end-of-semester course evaluations. You need to schedule midterm evaluations no later than Week 2 by working with your department coordinator . All surveys within a department will use the same questions for midterm evaluations and be conducted during the same five-day period.

We follow-up with you to review a short debrief of the qualitative results. SGIDs are intended to support modifications to the course to better help students. If you do not have control over the course structure, environment or assignments, mid-semester surveys may better suit your needs. End of semester course evaluations are required by the Office of the Provost for undergraduate courses with seven (7) or more students but may be requested for any course with department approval. For details, see the IDP website . CIE can assist you in analyzing the data and student comments generated by these evaluations in order to make informed decisions about teaching and learning strategies. Observing learning environments Inviting a CIE consultant into your classroom will provide a non-evaluative perspective on some aspects of the course or the teaching and learning environment. Prior to the observation, you will be asked what aspect of your teaching/course you would like to receive feedback on, and the observation will be tailored accordingly. In a follow-up conversation, the observer will share information on what was observed and offer suggestions or additional resources that align with the instructor\u2019s goals/desired feedback. Individual consultations Whatever service you choose will involve brief individual consultations before and after the service (onsite or remote). CIE consultants are also available for general one-on-one conversations about teaching and\u00a0learning.\u00a0Would you like to discuss teaching concerns such as: engaging learners, designing assignments, difficult classroom situations, making sense of mid-semester feedback or end-of-semester evaluations?\u00a0You can meet with us to talk about a broad variety of teaching topics. Please reach out to CIE now by completing this\u00a0short, confidential Qualtrics survey about your instructional goals, courses, and timeframe.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty Enhancing Accessibility Purdue University\u2019s Commitment Purdue University is committed to an inclusive and welcoming experience for all students, staff, faculty, and guests. We have a responsibility to identify and remove barriers to access in the way we design classes, assessments, events, programs, and other university experiences. If we incorporate access into our design initially, it may reduce or eliminate the need for individual accommodations and increase the level of inclusion and participation for everyone. To aid with our commitment to providing equal access for students, Purdue West Lafayette (PWL) instructors have a new partner in the educational process as they implement students\u2019 required accommodations provided by the Disability Resource Center (DRC). The Faculty Accessibility Consultant (FAC), Dr. Leslie Miller, in the Center for Instructional Excellence, is part of Purdue\u2019s shared responsibility to provide educational access to all students. Miller collaborates with all of the instructional community in Indianapolis and West Lafayette to assist with thinking through ways to implement students\u2019 required accommodations while maintaining the core elements of the course design and respecting the instructor\u2019s time. Dr. Miller can assist with the following: Creating different forms of assessments Navigating modified attendance accommodations Creating alternatives to oral presentations Group work strategies What in-class participation looks like with accommodations What is Universal Design (UD)? Universal Design is the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design. This concept was born out of architecture and design, but has great potential to impact disability-related access. PU considers Universal Design broadly. In the physical environment, we have guidelines for all campus planning, design and construction. In the technology environment, through a campus-wide IT accessibility committee that looks at accessibility of technology. In the curricular environment, through consultation with faculty on Universal Design for Learning. The Seven Principles of Universal Design: Equitable use: The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. Flexibility in use: The design accommodates a wide range of preferences and abilities. Simple and intuitive use: Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user\u2019s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level. Perceptible information: The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user\u2019s sensory abilities. Tolerance for error: The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions. Low physical effort: The design can be used efficiently and comfortable and with a minimum of fatigue. Size and space for approach and use: Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user\u2019s body size, posture, or mobility.

The following materials reflect a research-supported framework to help create a pathway to success in your course. Each semester, Innovative Learning reviews the syllabus framework, identifying needed updates and resources. Course Insights Syllabus Repository The Word files linked below outline Required and Recommended components for your syllabus. Many of these components are already in your Brightspace shell. They just need updates specific to your course. The files below include language that comes directly from University policies or is suggested by the University Senate or specific units. Other sample language reflects an autonomy-supportive classroom that can influence student perception and performance (Young-Jones, Levesque, Fursa & McCain 2019). Italicized text indicates notes to instructors. Plain text provides examples of language. Fall 2024 Required syllabus guidance Fall 2024 Recommended syllabus guidance Fall 2024 syllabus letter Tips for creating your syllabus: Don\u2019t revise what you don\u2019t have to. Resources listed under University Policies and Statements and the Student Services widget in the Brightspace shell are updated each semester and automatically populated. You may call these resources to your students\u2019 attention. Instructors cannot see the Student Services widget in Brightspace, but you can see the most recent version of it here . Feel free to add additional resources that might help your students to your syllabus. Once your syllabus is complete, please also upload it to Purdue\u2019s Course Insights syllabus archiving system. For questions related to the syllabus framework, email innovativelearningteam@purdue.edu . To see other resources and information go to the Office of the Vice Provost for Teaching and Learning website. Note: The Purdue syllabus guidelines are influenced by Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Course Transformation ( IMPACT ) and the resources available through Purdue\u2019s Brightspace learning management system (LMS). It also addresses criteria of the valid and reliable syllabus rubric published by the University of Virginia Center for Teaching Excellence (Palmer, Bach & Streifer 2017). Components fall under five categories: 1) Essential course information, instructor contact information, and course description, 2) Specific, student-centered learning outcomes and objectives that are clear, articulated and measurable (Bristol et al 2019), 3) Assessment strategies for all graded assignments that make explicit connections between learning outcomes, activities, and content, 4) Pedagogical approaches and activities that help students achieve the course outcomes and objectives, and 5) Policies and approaches that foster engaging, student-centered learning environments.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty Student Toolkit Communicating with Professors/TAS Communicating with Peers Know Your Schedule Communicating with Professors/TAS Prioritizing Assignments With Other Courses As soon as the semester starts go over all of the scheduled assignments and prioritize them according to their due dates. Calendar Include personal days/events so that your work schedule stays realistic. Communicating with Peers Find A Comfortable Place Find a place where you feel comfortable and can concentrate on your studies. Some learners prefer to go to the library to study, while others prefer to stay at home. Once you have found a good place to study, commit to that location. Know Your Schedule Reading Course Syllabus and Schedule Read your course syllabus and schedule exams, assignments, any project that has a due date so you can stay ahead on your studies. Communication Communicating with Professors/TAS Communicating with Peers Communicating with Professors/TAS Communicate with professors right away in emergency situations, just as you would do in a traditional face to face course.Attend virtual office hours. If you are not sure if your professor is hosting virtual office hours, contact them and ask. Professors at Purdue usually use WebEx to host virtual office hours. Utilize the Learning Management System (Brightspace) to stay connected. Communicating with Peers Use netiquette when participating in discussion boards. Keep in contact with the members of your group as you work together in assignments. Share with each other study habits. Schedule a time to meet virtually if time allows. Study Habits Have Dedicated Work Days With courses having different deadlines for assignments, projects, and readings, it is important to have a proper study structure in place. For example, you may have an online discussion post to read or write by Wednesday and respond to your peer\u2019s responses on Friday. Although it is possible to complete these tasks the day of, it is important to note that your instructors will not want you to only state your opinion. You will need to prove that you have been reading the readings, which will require more time. The best approach to submitting your assignments on time is by having dedicated work days. This allows you to complete your course tasks 2-3 times a week versus cramming for an assignment deadline. In this case, you should set personal deadlines of completing your discussion post that is due on Wednesday on Tuesday and your response to a peer that is due on Friday on Thursday. This provides you with a buffer so that you can have additional time if needed. This comes in handy when you need additional time writing your post, working on another assignment, or even taking a break to relax. Take Notes as You Watch Lectures Many online courses include helpful video lectures. It is important to watch and listen to these videos; however, writing notes are essential to this process. Take notes just as if you were in a traditional course. Complete Assignments in Smaller Chunks Do not procrastinate. Work on your assignment in sections instead of waiting until the last minute to complete the whole assignment. Figure out how much time you have to complete the assignment. Determine how long you will work at each sitting to complete the assignment. Think about the logical order of completing pieces. What should you do first, second, third, etc.? Complete your task early enough to have some time left for a final review. Eat Healthy Snacks Just because you are in an online course, does not mean healthy living is out of the picture. One way to stay focused and avoid any health challenges is by eating healthy snacks. Just as you should avoid eating heavy food items right before completing homework assignments, you should do the same for online courses. You want to make sure that your mind is focused and you\u2019re concentrating, but not starving. Here is a list of some possible healthy snacks that will keep you focused and energized: Popcorn Almonds Veggies String Cheese Grapes Granola Bars Hummus Yogurt Sunflower Seeds Set Mini Goals Pick a place and time. Everyone has their own idea about the best place and time to study. Whether it\u2019s your bedroom at night or the library after school, find a study space and a regular study time that works for you and stick with it. Make a point of studying a little bit every day. If you study a little bit every day you\u2019ll be continually reviewing things in your mind. This helps you understand things. It also helps you avoid the stress of last-minute cramming and pushing yourself late at night can make you too tired to study properly. Be Positive. Your attitude has a big impact on the level of study that you get done and the effectiveness of your learning process. If you keep saying that you can\u2019t do it and won\u2019t commit to the idea of learning, attempting to study is only likely to become more difficult. Instead, focus your mind on positive outcomes and on how you can use your own individual strengths to achieve them. Find the best way to learn Most of us have a preferred way of learning. Get to know your learning style and study in the ways you learn best. Auditory learners learn by listening. If you\u2019re an auditory learner you could try reading your notes aloud and discussing them with other people. You might like to record key points and play them back. Visual learners learn by seeing. If you\u2019re a visual learner you could use colors in your notes and draw diagrams to help represent key points. You could try to remember some ideas as images. Tactile/kinesthetic learners learn by doing. If you\u2019re a tactile/kinesthetic learner you could use methods like role-playing or building models to revise key points. Get Proper Rest Try to go to sleep and get up at the same time every day. Create a calm and restful sleep environment. Take time for relaxing activities before sleep. Limit caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, and big meals at night. Take Mini Breaks Study in chunked sessions: Your ability to retain information diminishes after about 25-30 minutes, so break it up into multiple, smaller sessions. Reward yourself with fun activities during your breaks. When you take a break, make sure you get away from your desk or study space. A bit of physical activity \u2013 even just a walk around the block \u2013 can sometimes help you to look at a problem in a different way and could even help you to solve it. Working with Groups Working in groups can be sometimes challenging when everyone has a different perspective. We\u2019ve all been in a situation where not everyone has pulled their weight, but it\u2019s something that we must master in the courses. The same thing applies to online courses. Helpful Tools Tips for Working Well in Groups Opening lines of communication Ex: Determining if the communication is via email, video chat, phone, etc. Determining roles for group members in the assignment Ex: Someone is the editor, project manager, or a researcher of a certain part of the assignment Planning goals in order to meet the deadline Being responsible of your portion of the assignment and communicating with your members Indicating to your instructor early on if there is a group problem. Ex: Letting your instructor know a group member has not participated. Tools There are a variety of tools that can take assist you in your online coursework and help you organize your information.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty First Year Online Purdue University\u2019s College of Science and College of Engineering saw the year of learning remotely due to the Covid-19 pandemic as an opportunity for innovation. All first-year high enrollment courses across the two Colleges were transformed to an online format, creating a high quality learning experience and a resource for our students. \u201dThe First Year Online\u201d working group of faculty from Science and Engineering worked closely with Purdue Online to create a set of materials that can be used widely to facilitate online course development, providing appropriate solutions to faculty and addressing student needs. First Year Online \u2013 Working Group \u2013 Community of Practice We would like to acknowledge the Purdue University faculty and staff that helped create all the materials for this project as well the time they took to meet each month to give their input into this project. College of Science Biological Sciences : Donna Fekete, Dennis Minchella Chemistry : Jonathan Rienstra-Kiracofe Computer Science : William Crum, Randy Bond, Monica Shively Mathematics : Phil Mummert, Jonathon Peterson, Joe Chen, Kenji Matsuki, Aaron Yip Physics : Carina Rebello, Sanjay Rebello College of Science : Peristera Paschou, Dennis Minchella, Angie Teel College of Engineering First Year Engineering : Sean Brophy, Kerrie Douglas, Jill Folkerts, Isabel Jinenez-Useche, Tamara Moore, Eric Nauman, Larry Nies, William Oakes, Matthew Ohland, Senay Purzer, Carla Zoltowski College of Engineering : Alina Alexeenko, Nina Robinson Purdue Online / TLT Tim Lombardo, Sarah Crago, Cody Connor, Jason Fish, Donna Cumberland First Year Online Faculty Guidebook The Faculty handbook was created through the interdisciplinary collaboration of the College of Engineering and College of Science faculty and leaders. The goal was to present faculty with best practices in online teaching and learning and technical advice to create high-end learning environments for their students. The handbook is divided into five sections: Program-Wide Considerations Instructional Technology Best Practices for Virtual Labs Best Practices for Online Interactions Assessment Best Practices Click this link to download the First Year Online Faculty Guidebook First Year Online Course Development Checklist Along with the handbook, a customized course development checklist was created meant to allow faculty to scan their courses for potential needs for revision. This checklist incorporates all of Purdue Online\u2019s QM-Correlated CDD Rubric while expanding it and arranging it based on Student \u2013 Content Interactions, Student \u2013 Student Interactions, and Student \u2013 Instructor Interactions. Click this link to download the First Year Online Course Development Checklist Brightspace Template The use of this template will help create a more harmonized look and feel across the First Year Online Engineering and Science courses, helping students navigate with ease as they switch from one course to the other. This template allows for flexibility in how the instructor teaches, weeks or modules while trying to achieve the goal of having students spend less time trying to learn how to navigate between courses and promotes more time learning.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty Global Learning Faculty and Student Development Mission Statement CIE\u2019s Global Learning Faculty and Student Development mission is to assist Purdue instructors to be stewards in optimizing and transforming classroom teaching and learning by integrating global issues, activities, and experiences into class content and learning objectives, so that all students, international and national alike, have a venue for unique, realistic global experiences and global learning. Global Learning Faculty and Student Development values the: Preparation of students for a global society including the integration of global issues into classroom learning. Effective, practical and efficient instruction by faculty. Opportunities to prepare all students for a global society. Multiple forms of diversity and globalization. Influences occurring outside the classroom that significantly interact with student success in learning. The mission statements and strategic plans of most colleges and universities emphasize the opportunity to prepare graduates for a global society and global citizenship. Even the introduction of intercultural knowledge and eventually developing competency is elusive, especially in assessing attitudes, skills, and knowledge, which fall under Bloom\u2019s Affective Domain. Global Learning Faculty Development at Purdue University provides faculty, staff, and instructors with teaching tips, resources and tools, including sample \u201cstarter kit\u201d assignments, to assist them in introducing the first steps for idea development when teaching intercultural learning. These resources map the process of learning to the intercultural attitudes, skills, and knowledge, using Bloom\u2019s Affective Domain of learning, to the Association of American Colleges & Universities VALUE Rubric Development Project.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty The Scholarship of Teaching And Learning (SoTL) What is SoTL? As an emerging field, definitions of SoTL often vary. We consider SoTL to include any scholarly inquiry which reflects on a topic related to teaching and learning, builds on previous research in the field, and is shared with peers. Reasons to engage in SoTL Improve student learning in your course Provide evidence of teaching effectiveness for tenure and promotion documents Provide research opportunities for graduate students Strengthen your application for internal and/or external teaching awards Contribute to the discussion of teaching and learning in your discipline SoTL project steps Identify a research question. Here are several examples of typical SoTL research questions: Does incorporating group work increase student performance on a final exam? How do students\u2019 beliefs about the field change from the beginning of the semester to the end of the semester? What is the relationship between watching instructor-created videos and student perceptions and performance in a course? Do a literature search to determine what research has already been done on this topic. Identify the data necessary to answer your question (e.g. student surveys, specific assignments, faculty reflections, student interviews or focus groups). Consider incorporating both qualitative and quantitative sources of data into your project. Collect and analyze your data (e.g. compare different semesters or sections of a course, analyze qualitative responses from students at the beginning and end of the semester). Share your project and results at an appropriate venue (e.g. conference, open-source journal, peer-reviewed journal). Interested in SoTL? Contact us!

The Teaching Academy conducted an intentional and deliberate research study that led to the Framework for Teaching Excellence . This Framework describes the elements of Exemplar, Enthusiast, Educator, Experimenter, and Explorer, and provides an operational framework for teaching excellence at Purdue West Lafayette. In 2022 the Teaching Academy launched the accompanying Guide for Developing and Documenting Teaching Excellence that serves as a tool for supporting the implementation of the five elements of the Framework . A goal of the guide is to help instructors recognize their strengths and expand their skills within and across the Framework elements. The Teaching Academy is a community of Purdue West Lafayette faculty who have demonstrated excellence in the disciplines of teaching, learning, and educational scholarship. Together with the Office of the Provost and the Center for Instructional Excellence, the Teaching Academy sponsors many programs and activities to foster educational creativity, innovation, and effectiveness.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty Purdue Virtual Labs Complex topics can be challenging both for instructors to teach and for students to learn. While instructional strategies have varied over the years, modern computer graphics environments can provide students with enhanced learning opportunities. By combining mixed reality technologies with physics-based modeling and simulation and authentic machine interfaces, virtual labs (VLs) can both enhance student learning and aid in review and assessment. Play Some students struggle to understand complex science, engineering, and technical concepts when first introduced. Typical lab environments for those courses may not have enough space, class time, or equipment for every student to have as many repetitions and learning opportunities as they need. Increased enrollment in specific academic programs has also placed a strain on available classroom teaching space. By using virtual labs, faculty can cover the most essential content during the specified class time, and students can interact with the virtual lab materials multiple times outside of class at their own pace. Whether for initial content presentation, or remediation, virtual labs can be effective instructional media. By leveraging technology and sound instructional design, virtual labs can provide: Enriched lab experience that is manageable and scalable More opportunities to interact with equipment Longer timescale experiments by providing additional iterations Supervised feedback Provide additional learning modalities for students Relief on infrastructure from unforeseen circumstances With the need to adapt instruction as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Purdue faculty are rapidly working to make their course content as flexible, scalable, and effective as possible by making labs available in various instructional environments. Whether the goal is to de-densify a classroom space, create supplemental materials for a hybrid class, provide accessibility to students unable to attend live classes, or transition to a fully online environment, virtual labs can provide customized solutions to enhance the learning experience for each course. Process for Developing Virtual Labs Contact the designated college representative listed below for College of Engineering/College of Science courses and Purdue Polytechnic Institute courses to start the process (see contact information below); Meet with the Envision Center and an instructional developer from the Innovative Learning Team for initial overview of course and objectives for the virtual lab; Establish a timeline for virtual lab development with the Envision Center. The Envision Center will need timely feedback from the instructor to keep on track with the VL production; Meet with an instructional developer from the Innovative Learning Team to develop instructional and assessment materials (optional); and Implement virtual labs in your course and revise with the Envision Center as needed Please note that the timeframe, resources needed, and commitment can vary based on the purpose and complexity of the virtual lab being developed.

IL Units Center for Instructional Excellence Directory Libraries and School of Information Studies Directory Purdue Online Directory News Indianapolis Faculty Learning Remotely Overview Start your journey with the Learning Remotely Quick Start . This guide is a checklist to help Purdue students jump-start into remote learning. Remote Learning means that some or all of your course is conducted online. Quick Start First Please bookmark this Learning Remotely webpage, which curates and prioritizes other resources to help you prepare to learn in an online environment. The page is updated frequently and new material will be identified as added. Your faculty will share information about their specific course in their syllabus or in Brightspace. On this page: 1. What can I expect? 2. How do I learn online? 3. How do I communicate in online classes? 4. How do I work collaboratively with my peers? 5. What accommodations are available? 6. Is there additional software support? 7. What additional student support is available? 1. What can I expect? Course elements will be online (discussions, assignments, labs, activities, etc.) and will be housed in Brightspace . Check your Purdue email and announcements in your courses for updates from your instructor, and review Brightspace to be sure you can find what you need to complete the course successfully. Here are some videos to help you. Review your syllabus and schedule\u2026and understand there may be changes. Spring 2020 was an unprecedented situation because of COVID-19. We are prepared for Fall 2020. Some things may change as the semester evolves. Check your course syllabus for information on the following: How will you communicate in your online course with your instructor and with your classmates? What are your instructor\u2019s expectations regarding course communication? Are there any other tools being used outside of Brightspace? If yes, check your access to these tools to ensure you can use them where you are located. How will you complete and submit learning activities (e.g., assignments, quizzes), how will you receive feedback on that work and how will it be assessed? Have any deadlines changed? Asynchronous delivery (not \u201clive\u201d) is encouraged as much as possible to provide stable content regardless of anyone\u2019s internet access and speed. Should your instructor decide to use a web-conferencing tool, such as Purdue-supported WebEx , for some elements of the course, you will need to follow the link they provide in order to access each \u201cmeeting.\u201d Some instructors may use other tools, such as GoogleMeet, Skype, Zoom, etc., but will provide specific instructions to you. Test these methods early and let your instructor know immediately if you have problems. \u25a1\u00a0As a Purdue student, you have free access to programs such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, by installing Office 365 on your personal device. 2. How do I learn online? Learning remotely allows for more flexibility than face-to-face classes, but requires you to establish your own routine. Often, you will not need to \u201cattend\u201d class during a specific day or time; however, especially if you are new to online learning, we encourage you to schedule time to log in and work on assignments. You should check your course announcements more than once a week. Assume that the work will require the same time commitment as if you were meeting face-to-face (i.e., 9-12 hours of study time per 3 credit hour course). Be actively involved in your classes and complete assignments on or before the due dates. For additional advice on good study habits, please view the Online Student Toolkit . Self-directed learning is integral to learning online. It is important that you take the time to study and learn using strategies that work best for you. Be active and stay engaged. You may want to set goals for each day or create a to-do list. Even though you are a remote learner, you can still have online study groups with your peers. Set aside time to email each other, chat or text, if for no other reason than just to hold each other accountable. If you are someone who may procrastinate, view this helpful guide to Overcoming Procrastination . In addition, regularly checking your understanding is important. This can be done by asking yourself the following questions: What did I learn this week? How do I know what I learned? How can I apply what I learned this week? Is something I learned this week still confusing or unclear? If so, focus on those topics or ask your instructor for clarification. Online discussions can continue to grow and develop, unlike face-to-face discussions limited by a specific class period. Participating once a week may not be enough to get the most out of the conversations. The following tips will help you to make the most of online discussions: Answer questions promptly, but be clear and concise. Provide concrete examples, for instance from readings or your own experience. Describe possible consequences or implications. Challenge something posted in the discussion, perhaps by playing \u201cdevil\u2019s advocate.\u201d Pose a clarifying question. Suggest a different perspective or interpretation. Pull in related information from other sources \u2013 books, articles, websites, other courses, etc. Make discussion posts CRISP:\u00a0considerate,\u00a0reflective,\u00a0interactive,\u00a0succinct, and\u00a0pertinent or purposefully. For additional ideas, see this sample discussion board rubric . Revisit the discussion boards often! Some people take 10 minutes a day to log in and review their course discussion boards, others set aside a chunk of time multiple days of the week. Either way, participating in the discussions through the week can increase what you learn about a topic by answering questions posed to you, engaging in other\u2019s discussions and seeking clarity from other\u2019s discussion posts. Take notes while watching all course videos, as if they were live lectures. When reading course materials, annotate what you are learning. Here\u2019s a great article covering Best Tips on How to Annotate an Article . The same tips can apply when reading your course textbook. Listen or view your course videos as often as you need to in order to grasp the concepts. Academic Success Center staff members are available to meet virtually to help as you develop and refine your online learning skills and strategies, including setting up a schedule, note-taking and reading strategies, study skills and more. To learn more, or schedule an appointment, go to the Academic Consultations page on the ASC website. Intellectual property guidelines apply in your online course. It\u2019s easy to copy and paste, but remember that work conducted in a password-protected online educational environment are educational records subject to federal privacy protection. Students and instructors own the work they author, subject only to the university\u2019s right to use it for educational purposes. This includes, but is not limited to email, papers, reports, presentations, videos, chats, blogs and discussion board posts. Do not copy, reproduce or post to any other outlet (e.g., Facebook, YouTube and other online outlets) any work of which you are not the sole author or have not obtained the permission of the author(s). The Purdue Honor Pledge that governs on-campus courses (especially at exam time) is in effect online as well. Academic integrity is one of Purdue\u2019s Student Rights and Responsibilities. Remember: \u201cAs a Boilermaker pursuing academic excellence, I pledge to be honest and true in all that I do. Accountable together \u2013 We are Purdue.\u201d 3. How do I communicate in online classes? Communicating about personal issues. If you run into personal issues, such as illness or family emergencies, communicate early and often with your instructor, especially if it means you cannot make course deadlines. Personal questions or concerns must be emailed to your instructor from your @purdue.edu email. Be professional in writing your email and be sure to include your full name and the course title in your email subject line. General course communications. Some courses may have an online discussion board dedicated to course-related questions. These discussion boards are a great way to ask or find answers to questions you (or your peers) have. Check whether your course(s) have these types of discussion boards. Netiquette. In online communications (text, email, chat, discussion board posts), tone does not always come across well because cues like your voice or facial expressions are missing. Always seek clarification and potential solutions when misunderstandings, disagreements, or problems occur. Do not focus on placing blame. Here are few tips: Be open to constructive criticism. Seek feedback and strive to understand its constructive value, even if the feedback seems critical. When you are asked to give feedback, do it in a constructive, professional manner. Avoid any statement or action (e.g., verbal statements, emails, online discussion posts) that might be interpreted as discriminatory, harassing, insensitive, offensive, or disrespectful toward any other student, staff, or faculty member. 4. How do I work collaboratively with my peers? The Online Student Toolkit provides an overview of different tools to help you collaborate with your peers in an online environment. Communication early and often is important. Determine if the communication is via email, video chat, phone, etc. Establish roles for group members in the assignment (e.g., someone is the editor, project manager, or researcher of a certain part of the assignment). One way to do this is by setting up a group contract or team agreement . Set goals in order to meet the deadline. Be accountable for your portion of the assignment and communicate with your team members. Let your instructor know early if there is a group problem, for example if a group member is not participating. 5. What accommodations are available? If you are a student registered with the Disability Resource Center (DRC), be sure you share your Course Accessibility Letter (CAL) with your instructors electronically, via myPurdue. Stay in touch with your DRC access consultant and your instructors to ensure accommodations are in place within the course\u2019s online environment. The DRC is not able to administer and proctor exams online but will support your instructors and you. Go to the Alternative Delivery of DRC Services to Students and Faculty webpage for the latest updates from the DRC. Engage with your instructors prior to taking a quiz or exam to assure there is clear understanding of the accommodations you need and how they will be delivered in the online environment. Recognize that, for some instructors, providing accommodations online is new. Proactive discussion can lead to the best experience for both your instructors and you. The DRC is available to consult with instructors about how to facilitate some of the less routine exam accommodations, such as the auditory format of an exam or use of assistive technology. If you feel as though you are not receiving accommodations you need, please contact your DRC access consultant or email drc@purdue.edu . 6. Is there additional software support? Purdue negotiates the availability of several software packages (e.g., Nvivo, SAS, and SPSS for graduate students) that students can install on personally owned computers at no cost or at a reduced cost. Eligibility for the software depends on requirements outlined in the product\u2019s software licensing agreement between the vendor and Purdue. But you must at least be an actively registered student to use this software. For more information, please view Purdue\u2019s OnTheHub website. 7. What additional student support is available? For real-time updates on how academic support resources are being delivered remotely \u2013 including the Writing Lab and access to Purdue Libraries \u2013 go to the Alternative Delivery of Academic Support Resources page on the ASC website. Most important, if you run into any issues while learning remotely, contact your instructor ASAP. In a remote learning environment, staying engaged and communicating early and often is vital to your completion of the course.

The grant, which was announced Tuesday (Sept. 30) and begins on Wednesday (Oct. 1), is through the DOE's First in the World Program , which seeks to improve postsecondary educational persistence and completion. \"There has been a lot of discussion in higher education about student-centered teaching and learning, about making instruction more engaging, and improving the learning environment through active learning,\" said Chantal Levesque-Bristol, director of the Center for Instructional Excellence at Purdue and a professor of educational studies. \"No large-scale, controlled, scientific study has been done in education to look at why active-learning models have been successful. We know they work, but if we don't know why we can't replicate the positive results.\" Purdue already has successfully transformed 120 large-enrollment courses as part of its Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Course Transformation (IMPACT) program, where more group work and active student-centered learning replace lectures, and about 300 courses are projected to be redesigned using this model by the 2016-17 academic year. Purdue President Mitch Daniels said the highly competitive First in the World grant validates the efforts Purdue has made in creating the curriculum of the future. \"This absolutely confirms our impression that Purdue is well out front in the development of teaching methods for the next-generation college experience,\" Daniels said. \"This work led by Dr. Levesque-Bristol will inform our work at Purdue, but will also be extremely valuable for our 11 partners in the University Innovation Alliance , where we are looking at the best way to enhance learning for low-income and first-generation students. The more we learn about why active learning works, the better we will be at enhancing the success of all students.\u201d U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said, \"After receiving nearly 500 applications from around the country, we're excited to announce Purdue University will receive a First in the World grant, funded for the first time this year. Each grantee demonstrated a high-quality, creative and sound approach to expand college access and improve student outcomes. We are confident these projects will have a positive impact on increasing access and completion and help us reach President Obama's 2020 goal, to once again have the highest share of college graduates in the world.\" Levesque-Bristol said she would examine active learning through a research project called Success Through Transformative Education and Active Mentoring. It will focus on science, technology, engineering, agriculture and math, or STEAM, courses. She said researchers would look at different active-learning strategies and identify the factors that make some more successful than others. \"The framework that I'm using is the 'self-determination theory' by Deci and Ryan,\" Levesque-Bristol said. \"According to the theory, students learn best when they feel competent, autonomous and connected. Autonomy in this case does not mean independence; it's volition or choice. For example, students tend to feel autonomous when they're given choices and options about how to perform or present their work. Autonomy for students also means they're engaged in learning. \"We'll also look at the impact of active-learning strategies on motivation. If students are motivated and engaged they'll be retained, they will earn better grades, and they will graduate on time.\" Levesque-Bristol said the study would build on IMPACT, the program that aims to change the way key foundation, large-enrollment classes are taught. From a student perspective, IMPACT classes incorporate new learning strategies and technologies to make courses more \"student-centered,\" for example, by replacing large lectures with more group work and active learning. \"We'll do this based on the success of IMPACT. We'll use the infrastructure of IMPACT - the faculty and students, the management team, the advisory board, and the professional development and assessment teams - in doing course transformation, and do it in a more intentional, rigorous and scientific manner,\" she said. Levesque-Bristol outlined how the study will work. \"STEAM courses, with multiple sections, will be selected after consulting the department, deans and faculty. The sections are equivalent at the start of the study, but then one section will become the control section and the other will become the experimental section,\" she said. \"The experimental section will undergo an IMPACT transformation, and the control section will be taught as usual. Pre- and post-test assessments, constructed by faculty and measuring faculty-identified learning outcomes, will be administered in the control and experimental sections. \"In addition, a student perception survey, including the basic psychological need measure (autonomy, competence, relatedness) and motivation measure, also will be administered pre and post in the control and experimental sections. Results will be compared for the control and experimental sections and examined in aggregate. We expect basic psychological need satisfaction and motivation to be higher in the experimental section, which in turn would impact learning outcomes and grades.\" According to the White House website, the First in the World competition began when President Obama proposed an investment of $55 million \u201cto support public and private colleges and nonprofit organizations as they work to develop and test the next breakthrough strategy that will boost higher education attainment and student outcome, while leading to reduced costs.\u201d Writer: Greg McClure, 765-496-9711, gmcclure@purdue.edu Sources: Chantal Levesque-Bristol, 765-496-6424, cbristol@purdue.edu Mitch Daniels, president@purdue.edu Denise Horn, assistant press secretary in U.S. Department of Education, Denise.Horn@ed.gov Related news release: Department of Education release: http://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/department-awards-75-million-first-world-grants-24-colleges-and-universities Related video: Purdue Active Learning Center: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V20ufq2nQ3E&feature=youtu.be Research News View RSS feed More Research News Communication OneCampus Brightspace Purdue Today Office 365 Outlook myPurdue Campus Faculty and Staff Careers Physical Facilities Directory Campus Map Construction Information Human Resources Calendar Libraries Information Technology Tuition Calculator Center for Healthy Living People Speak Up Diversity & Inclusion Ethics & Compliance Public Safety Annual Security Report Timely Warnings Purdue University, 610 Purdue Mall, West Lafayette, IN 47907, (765) 494-4600 \u00a9 2014-18 Purdue University | An equal access/equal opportunity university | Integrity Statement | Copyright Complaints | Brand Toolkit | Maintained by Marketing and Media Trouble with this page?

Overall, more than 600 courses have been impacted, many of which have seen significantly reduced DFW rates. Chantal Levesque-Bristol, whose Center for Instructional Excellence is part of an institutional team that comprises the Provost\u2019s Office, Teaching and Learning Technologies Unit, Institutional Assessment, the Purdue University Library and School of Information Studies, and the Evaluation and Learning Research Center, describes the evolution of IMPACT, lessons learned, and the central tenets that have led to its success. The purpose of this book is notonly to describe the program, but also to highlight the importance and implications of the underlying motivational theoretical framework guiding the initiative. Having started as a course redesign program that faltered in achieving its objectives, the breakthrough came with the introduction of the fundamental motivational principles of self determination theory (SDT) followed by the applications of these principles to the research in higher education leadership and pedagogy. Giving faculty fellows the autonomy to build on their disciplinary expertise, pursue their interests and predilections, within a guided framework, and leveraging interactions with colleagues through FLCs, stimulated faculty fellows\u2019 motivation and creativity.This book describes the core and structure of the IMPACT program, presents details of faculty learning curriculum, explains how the focus on SDT principles shaped the program\u2019s evolution and transformation from a course redesign to a professional faculty development program, and covers the considerations behind the formation of faculty fellow IMPACT teams A concluding chapter addresses how the IMPACT program, having helped faculty pivot to emergency remote teaching when the campus closed owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being modified so it can be successfully sustained online if circumstances require, or as a means to expand its reach in the future.While the principles behind this initiative will be of compelling interest to its primary audience of faculty developers, several chapters will have appeal to instructors and administrators.

Informed Learning Scale References About the Author Index Author(s) Biography Chantal Levesque-Bristol is the Executive Director of Center for Instructional Excellence and professor of Educational Psychology at Purdue University. She received her doctorate in Social Psychology from the University of Ottawa. Her primary areas of interests are teaching and learning, motivation, educational psychology, faculty development, and institutional change. She is the Principal Investigator on a First in the World Grant from the Department of Education. George D. Kuh is Chancellor's Professor of Higher Education Emeritus at Indiana University and adjunct research professor of education policy at the University of Illinois. Critics' Reviews From the Foreword: \u201cEspousing the value of deep, relevant student learning and effective teaching is one thing. Creating the institutional conditions that encourage and reward the use of promising approaches to scale and sustain such work is quite another. This is what sets Purdue University\u2019s \u2018Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Course Transformation\u2019 (IMPACT) apart from many well-designed faculty development and institutional improvement efforts. Effective professional development programs do not just happen. Considerable planning and expertise are required to determine what instructional staff \u2018need\u2019 (as distinguished from what they may \u2018want\u2019) to improve their performance. But poor implementation can derail the best devised plans. The planning, implementation activities, and perceived benefits must be relevant and meaningful to sustain the interest and participation by university faculty who are highly autonomous skilled professionals. In these regards, there is much to learn from IMPACT and this book about how to successfully deliver timely, substantive high quality professional development experiences to a particularly discerning audience.\u201d George D. Kuh, Chancellor\u2019s Professor Emeritus of Higher Education Indiana University \u201cJohn Thibaut was Kurt Lewin\u2019s last student and talked of walking along the Charles with him. He was my advisor. It\u2019s great to read a book so grounded in Lewin\u2019s maxim that there\u2019s nothing so practical as a good theory. Chantal Levesque-Bristol and her colleagues at Purdue University West Lafayette employed Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to operationalize environments for faculty and their students characterized by autonomy, competence, and relatedness. They designed, implemented, and assessed this powerful program of professional development entitled 'Instruction Matters: Purdue Academic Course Transformation' (IMPACT) to transform particular courses, which is proving transformational for the campus. Levesque-Bristol and her colleagues have clearly put an important theoretical approach to work in supporting student learning and achievement. Equally powerfully, she reports how she and her colleagues modified the program for Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) in response to the pandemic, and the success of that program in continuing support to faculty and thus students through very difficult times. This raises interesting long term possibilities for remote faculty development.\u201d Scott Evenbeck, Founding President Guttman Community College, and Founding Dean and Professor Emeritus at IUPUI Shipping Options We offer free standard shipping on every order across the globe.
