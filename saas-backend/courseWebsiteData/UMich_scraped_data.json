This season, the Players expand their repertoire with the addition of Moving the Needle : a performance focused on sexual harassment in the academy. Together, audiences discuss strategies to anticipate and respond to occurrences of sexual harassment, and to make cultures that resist harassment in the first place. In addition to a full schedule of classic sketches (such as 7 into 15 , Cuts , and Tenure Decisions ), the Players are researching and developing a new performance concerning the experiences of first generation college students in higher education. In every session, the CRLT Players continue to prompt reflection on topics like social identity, campus climate, and belonging, and to prepare audiences to create more inclusive spaces at the University of Michigan and beyond.

Midterm Student Feedback Please note that we are no longer accepting requests for Midterm Student Feedback (MSF) sessions in Fall 2024 term. You may complete this form for MSFs you'd like to schedule for Winter 2025. U-M login required. Gathering Midterm Student Feedback (MSF) is valuable for identifying areas for instructional improvement. Many instructors have found that simple changes early on can help motivate students and enhance student learning. Students tend to like the process because it gives them a chance to voice opinions on issues that are most critical to them, and they appreciate the fact that the instructor has solicited their opinions. CRLT is pleased to offer both in-person and remote approaches to collecting midterm student feedback. As always, CRLT consultants will work with instructors to design a process that best meets their needs. Please see below for the most common MSF options. In all cases, the process is confidential; the CRLT consultant will share student feedback only with the instructor. Options for Midterm Student Feedback (MSF) Consultations and Course Observations Survey Methods: Working with the instructor, CRLT consultants construct a brief survey consisting of closed- and open-ended questions targeted to the instructor\u2019s specific course context and concerns. Surveys are distributed electronically to students with survey results collected and compiled by the CRLT consultant. The survey method can be combined with in-person or remote forms of course observation. Consultation on Feedback Gathered by the Instructor: For instructors who prefer to collect student feedback themselves, CRLT consultants can advise on a process that will generate the most useful feedback. To access sample templates click here . This method can also be combined with in-person or remote forms of course observation. Small Group Method: This approach involves the use of facilitated small group discussions among students to identify course strengths and potential changes that would assist their learning. The instructor arranges to have a CRLT consultant visit the class early in the semester. The consultant arrives at the beginning of the class period and observes until there are approximately 25 minutes left. At that time, the instructor turns the class over to the consultant and leaves. The consultant explains the procedure and its purpose and then divides the class into groups of 3-5 students. Each group addresses the following questions: What are the major strengths of this course for your learning? What changes could be made in the course to assist you in learning? Students are asked to discuss each of these questions in their groups. The groups then share their responses with the whole class, and the consultant clarifies and records responses. Course materials review If requested by the instructor, CRLT Consultants can also review and provide feedback about course materials (such as CANVAS organization, syllabi, rubrics, slide decks, lesson plans, etc.) This can be combined with the other methods mentioned above. Debriefing Regardless of method, the consultant will meet remotely or in person with the instructor to review student feedback and discuss possible responses. If the consultant observed the class, these observations will also be shared and discussed. Ideally, this debriefing session will take place before the class meets again. Consultation services are available to faculty, postdocs and graduate students affiliated with the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor campus. If you have an urgent question or concern about a time-sensitive teaching matter, or if you do not receive a response from us within 72 hours of your submitted request, please call CRLT at 764-0505 or email ( crlt@umich.edu ). Classroom Observation To request a Classroom Observation, please fill out our Classroom Observation request form here . U-M login required. Classroom observation followed by consultation is available to faculty, postdocs and graduate students affiliated with the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor campus. CRLT consultants can observe in-person and remote courses. Additionally, CRLT consultants can review and provide feedback on class material including recorded lectures used in asynchronous courses. Teaching Philosophy Statements To request a consultation on your statement of teaching philosophy, please fill out our Teaching Philosophy request form here . U-M login required. Statements of teaching philosophy are a form of academic writing that is unfamiliar to many. CRLT is happy to serve as an outside reader as you develop your teaching statement for the academic job market or for promotion and tenure. Consultation services are available to graduate students, postdocs, and faculty affiliated with the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor campus. CRLT also has research about Teaching Philosophies, strategies for writing a successful statement, and examples of statements from U-M graduate students and postdocs. Graduate students may also be interested in the U-M Graduate Teacher Certificate program which requires a teaching statement. We are not able to provide feedback on stand alone diversity statements, though we do provide feedback on diversity, equity, and inclusion aspects of teaching philosophy statements. Rackham will provide feedback on diversity statements for students completing the Rackham Professional Development Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Certificate.

These programs are designed to help new faculty, lecturers, and GSIs learn about U-M students, find the resources they need to be successful, and begin to develop a community of colleagues. Click on the title below for more information. Campus-Wide\u00a0New Faculty Orientation The Office of the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) will once again conduct a New Faculty Orientation to introduce all new faculty to the University of Michigan. The Campus-Wide New Faculty Orientation is held every year before the beginning of the Fall semester. The next orientation will be held on Wednesday, August 21, 2024. Campus-Wide GSI Teaching Orientation This orientation is intended for GSIs teaching on the Ann Arbor campus. More details can be found on our GSITO page. LSA New Lecturer Orientation The LSA New Lecturer Orientation is designed to help lecturers learn about relevant LSA policies and resources that can support them in their teaching, teach them more about setting up course technology, and allow them to talk with experienced LSA lecturers about U-M culture and resources. We hope this is a starting point for lecturers to build community among yourselves across departments. Provost's Campus Leadership Program for Chairs and Associate Deans This program, organized jointly by the Office of the Provost and the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, meets monthly during the academic year. It is for faculty on the Ann Arbor campus. In September the session is 1\u00bd days and is for newly appointed chairs and associate deans only. It focuses on information such as the University budget process, working with academic employee unions, and managing staff and colleagues. The remaining sessions include all chairs and associate deans and focus on concerns such as running department/college meetings, creating and implementing a vision for the department/school, and faculty hiring. Program and schedule information is sent to chairs and associate deans annually in the late summer.

Our academies are listed below. If you have any questions regarding our teaching academies or future participation opportunities, please contact crlt@umich.edu. CRLT also offers a variety of orientations for faculty and graduate students. LSA Teaching Academy Since 2009, CRLT has collaborated with the LSA dean\u2019s office on a Teaching Academy focused on the specific needs of new tenure-track faculty in LSA. Opening with an intensive, two-day program in August, the Academy prepares faculty to teach at Michigan.\u00a0 The academy typically includes a student panel with LSA undergraduates, a faculty panel, conversations with administrators on common challenges and key school policies, and pedagogy sessions on topics such as inclusive teaching and active learning.\u00a0In their first term of teaching, members of the Academy work individually with a CRLT consultant on a process for gathering midterm student feedback from their students. Follow-up gatherings during the academic year focus on additional aspects of teaching within the College. Health Sciences Teaching Academy The Health Sciences Teaching Academy (HSTA) was developed in 2011 by the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) in collaboration with the Health Sciences Deans Council. Its purpose is to provide support to faculty who are in their first three years of teaching at the University of Michigan. It is intentionally interprofessional with the goal of building networks and sharing teaching strategies across disciplinary boundaries. The academy runs virtually each year from January-June and includes 5 monthly workshops and 2 individual coaching sessions with the HSTA director. This format maximizes accessibility and customizability of the program to meet the individual needs of each participants. The content of the academy is updated each year to reflect current educational best practices for equity-focused teaching in online, didactic and clinical settings. Since 2013, CRLT has collaborated with the dean\u2019s office on a teaching academy focused on the specific needs of new faculty in the Ross School of Business. The academy includes a student panel with BBA and MBA students, conversations with administrators on common challenges and key school policies, and pedagogy sessions on inclusive teaching and active learning. College of Engineering New Faculty Orientation The day before the campuswide new faculty orientation (NFO), CRLT in Engineering provides\u00a0additional programming for new CoE faculty. Participants engaged in a workshop about inclusive teaching, a panel discussion with U-M engineering undergraduate students, a presentation about research resources with a complementary panel discussion with experienced faculty about starting a research group, and a workshop on strategies for new faculty success. Subsequent programs cover\u00a0applying for the first grant, preparing for the third year review, mentoring graduate students, teaching with technology, supporting students in distress, preparing for tenure and promotion, and enhancing leadership skills.

The provost invites individual faculty members to participate and then hosts the seminars. Invitation lists include\u00a0faculty at all ranks and from all U-M schools and colleges, especially those with special interest or expertise in the seminar topic. The 125+ attendees are campus leaders in curricular and instructional innovation. While the Office of the Provost selects the themes for the seminars, the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching (CRLT) is the primary organizer of the events.

CRLT can help faculty in academic units explore innovative pedagogical approaches, collect data to inform curricular revision or the evaluation of educational grants, and provide resources for designing and running effective GSI training programs. Provost's Campus Leadership Program for Chairs and Associate Deans This program, organized jointly by the Office of the Provost and the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, meets monthly during the academic year. It is for faculty on the Ann Arbor campus. In September the session is 1\u00bd days and is for newly appointed chairs and associate deans only. It focuses on information such as the University budget process, working with academic employee unions, and managing staff and colleagues. The remaining sessions include all chairs and associate deans and focus on concerns such as running department/college meetings, creating and implementing a vision for the department/school, and faculty hiring. Program and schedule information is sent to chairs and associate deans annually in the late summer. Customized Discipline-Specific Workshops and Retreats In collaboration with faculty steering committees, CRLT designs customized workshops and retreats to address an academic unit's specific teaching and learning needs. Departments can also apply for CRLT grants to fund the retreats and to implement plans to improve teaching and learning that develop from such events. Assessment, Curriculum, & Learning Analytics Services Whether you need to assess the effectiveness of an educational program or intervention, launch a process to design or enhance a curriculum, or prepare for accreditation or external review, CRLT offers services that can support your work . Our approach is centered on student learning, guided by your priorities and focused on action. These services can include approaches grounded in learning analytics, such as analysis of student institutional data, visualizations of student pathways through a curriculum, investigations of student performance on course-level assignments or usage of course-level resources. We use a fee-based approach for more intensive services, but are happy to work with you to develop an approach that can meet your budget and needs. To connect with us about a potential project, submit a consultation request here . Resources for Departmental GSI Training CRLT has resources available to assist schools, colleges and departments as they develop or improve training programs to meet the needs of their GSIs. CRLT staff are available to discuss general issues of GSI training with GSI Coordinators, Graduate Student Mentors, or other departmental representatives. Such discussion can include how best to incorporate CRLT resources into a GSI training program.

Departments can also apply for CRLT grants to fund the retreats and to implement plans to improve teaching and learning that develop from such events. Possible Topics for Retreats or Programs Innovative Teaching Techniques Faculty may want to consider new approaches to teaching in their discipline (e.g., problem-based learning, innovative uses of technology, incorporating multicultural content into the curriculum). In collaboration with faculty in the unit, CRLT's consultants can help define the topic, develop resources to support the innovation, describe current best practices, or search for an outside speaker who would provide the necessary expertise in the area in question. CRLTs programs always feature faculty from the unit. In the past, such programs have ranged from half-day workshops to a series of presentations over the course of a month. Facilitating Exchanges About Current Practice Faculty in a unit may wish to spend time exchanging strategies and learning more about how their colleagues approach teaching and learning. CRLT can work with faculty to define the issues and then facilitate the discussion itself. Such discussions might also be informed by the results of information collected from undergraduates, graduate students, or alumni about their experiences in the program. Effective Practices for Evaluating Teaching CRLT staff can work with academic units to develop sound and useful systems for evaluating teaching. Consultants can provide information and conduct seminars about multiple methods of evaluating teaching, including student ratings, peer observation and peer review of materials, and teaching portfolios.

CRLT\u2019s Foundational Course Initiative (FCI) partners with department teams to redesign foundational courses, which are typically large introductory or early career courses, that offer gateways into a field of study. Our mission is to transform these courses into engaging, equitable, and inclusive learning experiences for all students. Why is it important? Foundational courses introduce students to a discipline or a course of study and are pivotal in their future career paths. Due to their size and the wide range of student backgrounds, they present both unique instructional challenges and outsized opportunities for impact across the University. Furthermore, structural inequities and historical exclusion show up in these courses as in all higher education. Equity-focused teaching and other high-impact practices address disparate outcomes and ensure engaging and deep learning experiences for all students. Using evidence-based teaching practices we seek to transform these courses into experiences that allow every student to further explore their interests and thrive in their chosen disciplines and future careers. By focusing on large enrollment courses, we have the opportunity to positively affect the learning experience and create educational equity for tens of thousands of students. In the 2022-2023 academic year alone, over 40.5% of all undergraduates at the University of Michigan were enrolled in FCI courses. How do we partner with these large courses? Designing learning and teaching experiences that are purposeful, equitable, and effective requires a holistic approach. Our team-based transformational process unites FCI consultants with course teams composed of instructors, staff, graduate, and undergraduate students. These collaborative course design (CCD) teams engage in a three-year process that is highly iterative, goal-driven, and data-informed. Why Participate? FCI enables department teams to turn their visions into reality through a three-year partnership that provides: Educational design expertise and dedicated consultants for each course Resources necessary for large-scale change, including $10,000 per year for course design and implementation needs Implementation of equity-focused teaching principles and practices Comprehensive data gathering and analysis to inform course design decisions Instructional team development and training for student assistants Robust logistical support and coordination to enable transformation REACH OUT TO US WITH QUESTIONS How is the Initiative Funded? With a renewed investment of $7.2 million from the President\u2019s Academic Excellence Fund, CRLT\u2019s Foundational Course Initiative (FCI) aims to create a 21st-century model for teaching that is grounded in collaborative course design and inclusive practices. FCI consultants provide the time, resources, and infrastructure to make course transformation adaptive, impactful, and sustainable. By establishing a new standard for innovative, collaborative course design and implementation, U-M is striving to lead the world in teaching foundational subjects at scale. Who is Participating?

Nomination Form View current and past winning innovations Goals To recognize faculty who have developed an innovative project, e.g., new approaches to creating inclusive classrooms, new uses of instructional technology, new ways to engage students in the learning process, new approaches to student collaboration, or new methods for replicating the advantages of a small course in a large lecture. To encourage the dissemination of best practices by sharing promising innovations with faculty more broadly. For the 2024 competition, we encourage innovations in 2 domains: Anti-racist teaching and innovations to disrupt patterns of educational disenfranchisement (equity-focused teaching) Strategies that help students understand the potential uses and limitations of Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, UM GPT, Dall-E, etc) and develop skills for a future that includes GenAI Award The award will provide $5,000 to five faculty members (or teams) for their innovative projects to improve student learning. (The timing of the funds' disbursement may be delayed in exceptional situations.) The projects will be recognized each May at the annual campus-wide teaching and instructional technology conference, Enriching Scholarship. Awardees will be asked to share their innovations with the broader U-M community at Enriching Scholarship, other campus-wide events, and with the academic world more broadly. Eligibility The award is open to tenured and tenure-track faculty, clinical instructional faculty, and lecturers who have ongoing teaching appointments on the University's Ann Arbor campus. Nominations Nominations from the full range of instructional settings at U-M are encouraged. All Ann Arbor campus faculty, GSIs, students, chairs, directors, deans, and staff members may nominate individuals for this prize. Faculty self-nominations are also accepted. All nominations should use the online registration form , which opens on December 1st. Selection Criteria All innovations should have the following characteristics: Originality - new instructional approach/method or novel/creative application of a current instructional approach/method Impact - demonstrated significant impact on teaching effectiveness, student learning and/or retention Replicability - potential for use of this innovation by other instructors Scalability - potential for widespread use of this innovation Selection Process Nominations will be judged by a faculty committee that will recommend winners to the Provost. The application and selection process will involve two steps. Step One: One-page nomination forms will be reviewed by the selection committee.\u00a0 Finalists will be invited to submit full applications for Step Two. Step Two: Finalists from Step One will submit a narrative and support materials that document the effectiveness of their innovation, such as: examples of teaching materials (e.g., portfolio, weblinks, and video clips) information about the origin of the innovative idea evidence of impact on student learning and attitudes, including letters of support from current or past students The selection committee will recommend winners to the Provost, who will make the final decision.

This year\u2019s Equity-focused Teaching at Michigan May Series aims to foster critical reflective practices as a central component of Equity-focused Teaching. Using the lens of \u201cpractice\u201d means we can think critically about the patterns of inequity and power that take shape in often subtle yet impactful ways through our actions over time.

                            "Reframing Rigor to Promote Equity in Teaching and LearningFri, 02/24/2023In scientific research, rigor refers to the level of care and precision used in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments and studies. For example, the National Institute of Health (NIH), a major funding source for medical and biological sciences, requires grant applications and progress reports to adhere to a strict standard of rigor. In this setting, scientific rigor is defined as: \u201cthe strict application of the scientific method to ensure unbiased and well-controlled experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation and reporting of results.\u201d While this definition is STEM specific, descriptions of rigor in other disciplines also focus on thoughtfully executing one\u2019s work, ensuring it is grounded in scholarship, and examining one\u2019s biases in analysis and interpretation (e.g., see Gill & Gill, 2020; Langtree, Birks, & Biedermann, 2019; and Riggs & B\u00fcchler, 2007).How might we conceptualize rigor in a college teaching setting? At a minimum, it would involve thoughtfully chosen, clearly laid out learning goals, targeted assessments of those goals, and learning activities designed for students to reach those goals, independent of student demographic or background. The design and implementation of a rigorous course would be grounded in the scholarship of teaching and learning for the discipline. Additionally, an indicator of rigor would measure how many students (and by how much) have pushed the boundaries of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes in order to meet the course objectives.Read more"

We know that students have benefitted from this approach to course elements such as absences and deadlines.As we move into the Fall 2022 semester, we are hearing a range of approaches to flexibility. For some instructors, this reflects a long-standing commitment to allowing students multiple ways to navigate their course and demonstrate learning. Others, especially those teaching large courses, have reported that student expectations for flexibility around course modality, grading, and attendance have become unmanageable for them and seem to have led to student disengagement as well.So, what do you do this fall?Read more"

To offer context about the current moment and suggestions for navigating it, we have asked Joy Pehlke, Health Educator and Wellness Coach at University Health Service and Lecturer in LSA, to write this guest blog post.My role atWolverine Wellnessallows me to witness the student experience in multiple ways: through one-on-one wellness coaching conversations, well-being presentations, and discussions in my class,ALA 240: Living Well in College and Beyond. Many students, staff, and faculty hoped that things would get easier once we could go back to some sense of \u201cnormalcy.\u201d \u00a0Instead, a common theme has emerged. We are struggling with the tension ofwishing things would get easier and finding they\u2019ve only become more complicated. We are seeing higher levels of stress and anxiety, and it has become clear that pre-existing issues on campus (burnout, overwhelm, perfectionism, imposter syndrome, racism, loneliness, etc.) have only been amplified by the pandemic. And these aren\u2019t just student issues. Instructors are impacted, too.Read more"

Read more May 13-17: Hot Topics in Equity-focused Teaching @ Michigan, May Series Thu, 03/28/2024 Now in its eighth year, this annual series of workshops is open to all U-M instructors. Each workshop offers opportunities to engage with colleagues from across the university and to think through a range of timely equity-focused teaching questions, challenges, and strategies. You are welcome to register for one or all of the workshops in this one-week series. Sessions are free and open to U-M instructors in any field. Read more Engaging Students by Integrating Career Development into Your Course Mon, 10/02/2023 Guest Author: Paul Barron, LSA Opportunity Hub We\u2019re heading towards that point in the semester where students\u2019 engagement may wane as they juggle competing deadlines and responsibilities. While it can help to revisit the syllabus and remind students of upcoming deadlines, another way to promote engagement is to address a topic they\u2019re stressing about: looking for jobs and internships. This blog post offers a range of ways that instructors can help students identify links between their courses and their future careers. For more ideas, and to spend time considering approaches to engaging students in your course by connecting it to their career exploration, register for this CRLT workshop: Engaging Students by Integrating Career Development Into Your Course Friday, October 27, from 12:00 pm - 02:00 pm (lunch provided). Read more Equity-Focused Teaching at Michigan: Investigating our Practices Mon, 04/17/2023 At CRLT we continue to develop our understanding of equity-focused teaching as an ongoing process of learning from doing, reflecting on our impact, and critically investigating our practices. This year\u2019s Equity-focused Teaching at Michigan May Series aims to foster critical reflective practices as a central component of Equity-focused Teaching. Using the lens of \u201cpractice\u201d means we can think critically about the patterns of inequity and power that take shape in often subtle yet impactful ways through our actions over time. Critical reflection is the work of actively examining and unpacking these patterns, using our experiences as evidence, in dialogue with others\u2019 perspectives and knowledge. Read more Reframing Rigor to Promote Equity in Teaching and Learning Fri, 02/24/2023 In scientific research, rigor refers to the level of care and precision used in the design, execution, and interpretation of experiments and studies. For example, the National Institute of Health (NIH), a major funding source for medical and biological sciences, requires grant applications and progress reports to adhere to a strict standard of rigor. In this setting, scientific rigor is defined as: \u201cthe strict application of the scientific method to ensure unbiased and well-controlled experimental design, methodology, analysis, interpretation and reporting of results.\u201d While this definition is STEM specific, descriptions of rigor in other disciplines also focus on thoughtfully executing one\u2019s work, ensuring it is grounded in scholarship, and examining one\u2019s biases in analysis and interpretation (e.g., see Gill & Gill, 2020; Langtree, Birks, & Biedermann, 2019; and Riggs & B\u00fcchler, 2007). How might we conceptualize rigor in a college teaching setting? At a minimum, it would involve thoughtfully chosen, clearly laid out learning goals, targeted assessments of those goals, and learning activities designed for students to reach those goals, independent of student demographic or background. The design and implementation of a rigorous course would be grounded in the scholarship of teaching and learning for the discipline. Additionally, an indicator of rigor would measure how many students (and by how much) have pushed the boundaries of their knowledge, skills, and attitudes in order to meet the course objectives. Read more ChatGPT: Implications for Teaching and Student Learning Mon, 01/09/2023 Recently, the artificial intelligence app ChatGPT has been making headlines in the higher education media and beyond. Some have taken an alarmist approach, such as a recent Atlantic piece titled \u201cThe College Essay Is Dead.\u201d Others have been more sanguine, examining the limitations of the app as well as offering suggestions for how it can inform student learning and writing. Below is an FAQ about ChatGPT that includes links to useful resources. Read more Structuring Classroom Discussions About Elections Tue, 10/11/2022 This midterm election season brings an important opportunity for students and instructors to connect classroom learning to the value of civic engagement. Developments in law and politics at the national level have highlighted the particular importance of state and local civic engagement. The Center for Research on Learning and Teaching works with instructors to think through approaches to incorporating discussion of the midterm election and its links to civic engagement into their courses, as well as strategies for responding in the moment when these issues arise. Encouraging students to engage in the US democratic process is a non-partisan activity This post shares highlights from resources curated for faculty and staff to not only encourage voter engagement, but also to support the development of students\u2019 habits of democracy before and after the upcoming election. Regardless of citizenship status, domestic and international students benefit from understanding how democracy works. Read more Teaching in Fall 2022: Balancing Flexibility and Accountability Mon, 08/22/2022 Over the past two years, instructors across the university have learned a great deal about ways to build flexibility into their courses, a core principle of equitable teaching. We know that students have benefitted from this approach to course elements such as absences and deadlines. As we move into the Fall 2022 semester, we are hearing a range of approaches to flexibility. For some instructors, this reflects a long-standing commitment to allowing students multiple ways to navigate their course and demonstrate learning. Others, especially those teaching large courses, have reported that student expectations for flexibility around course modality, grading, and attendance have become unmanageable for them and seem to have led to student disengagement as well. So, what do you do this fall?

Read more \u201cHelp: My students are overwhelmed, and so am I!\u201d Tue, 11/16/2021 Guest Author:\u00a0Joy Pehlke, Wolverine Wellness A common theme we are hearing from instructors across campus is the level of stress they and their students are experiencing this term. To offer context about the current moment and suggestions for navigating it, we have asked Joy Pehlke, Health Educator and Wellness Coach at University Health Service and Lecturer in LSA, to write this guest blog post. My role at Wolverine Wellness allows me to witness the student experience in multiple ways: through one-on-one wellness coaching conversations, well-being presentations, and discussions in my class, ALA 240: Living Well in College and Beyond . Many students, staff, and faculty hoped that things would get easier once we could go back to some sense of \u201cnormalcy.\u201d \u00a0Instead, a common theme has emerged. We are struggling with the tension of wishing things would get easier and finding they\u2019ve only become more complicated . We are seeing higher levels of stress and anxiety, and it has become clear that pre-existing issues on campus (burnout, overwhelm, perfectionism, imposter syndrome, racism, loneliness, etc.) have only been amplified by the pandemic. And these aren\u2019t just student issues. Instructors are impacted, too.

Ina Zaimi Instructional Consultant, Foundational Course Initiative 1071 Palmer Commons \u2022 100 Washtenaw Ave. zaimina@umich.edu Dr. Ina Zaimi received her B.S. in Biomolecular Science and English, M.S. in Chemistry, and Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Michigan. Ina also received her secondary education certification in Chemistry and English from the State of Michigan. Humanizing chemistry incited her transition from teaching English, to teaching chemistry, to qualitatively researching the teaching and learning of chemistry. Her research explored organic chemistry students\u2019 reasoning, from tasks designed and conducted in a research setting to activities and assignments designed and implemented in a classroom setting. Design does not (and should not) equate implementation, so her research explored how chemistry graduate student instructors implement instructional materials and facilitate organic chemistry students\u2019 reasoning in the classroom. Therefore, her research combined the learning and teaching of organic chemistry and proposed how research can be transferred into instruction. Ina has been a Graduate Student Instructor for general chemistry, organic chemistry, and first-year writing, and she has received awards for her teaching. Furthermore, Ina has been a Graduate Student Instructional Coach in the Chemistry Department and a Graduate Student Instructional Consultant in the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, and she has received awards for her leadership.

Ina Zaimi Instructional Consultant, Foundational Course Initiative 1071 Palmer Commons \u2022 100 Washtenaw Ave. zaimina@umich.edu Dr. Ina Zaimi received her B.S. in Biomolecular Science and English, M.S. in Chemistry, and Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Michigan. Ina also received her secondary education certification in Chemistry and English from the State of Michigan. Humanizing chemistry incited her transition from teaching English, to teaching chemistry, to qualitatively researching the teaching and learning of chemistry. Her research explored organic chemistry students\u2019 reasoning, from tasks designed and conducted in a research setting to activities and assignments designed and implemented in a classroom setting. Design does not (and should not) equate implementation, so her research explored how chemistry graduate student instructors implement instructional materials and facilitate organic chemistry students\u2019 reasoning in the classroom. Therefore, her research combined the learning and teaching of organic chemistry and proposed how research can be transferred into instruction. Ina has been a Graduate Student Instructor for general chemistry, organic chemistry, and first-year writing, and she has received awards for her teaching. Furthermore, Ina has been a Graduate Student Instructional Coach in the Chemistry Department and a Graduate Student Instructional Consultant in the Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, and she has received awards for her leadership.

It recognizes that systemic inequities shape all students\u2019 individual and group-based experiences of social identity and produce vastly different relationships of power in and outside of the classroom, which impact students\u2019 learning and success. The corrective work of equity-focused teaching involves deliberately cultivating a learning environment where students: Have equal access to learning Feel valued and supported in their learning Experience parity in achieving positive course outcomes Share responsibility for the equitable engagement and treatment of all in the learning community. Equity-focused teaching is an ongoing commitment and practice that should develop across the life of a teaching career. This commitment is always in the service of achieving just experiences and outcomes for both students and teachers alike. Principles Critical Engagement of Difference Critically engaging difference acknowledges students\u2019 different identities and experiences; leveraging student diversity as an asset for learning. Using an equity-focused lens to think about difference means: Actively learning about the social, political and economic conditions that shape students\u2019 lives and learning. Accounting for those systems and conditions by reconstructing what we consider 'fair' or 'equal' with equity-focused practices. Identifying our teaching practices and institutional norms as contributing to and maintaining disparities; not seeing students\u2019 identities as a problem to be solved or barrier to overcome. Rejecting a deficit model! Additional Equity-focused Teaching Strategies for Critical Engagement of Difference Structured Interactions Structured interactions involves developing protocols or processes that support equitable access and contributions to interactive elements of the learning environment \u2013 and disrupt patterns that reinforce systemic inequities Using an equity-focused lens to think about structured interactions means: Creating invitations and norms for participation that give students options for engagement Thinking ahead about how you might handle classroom dynamics that perpetuate systemic inequities and have a plan to address them. Deliberately organizing student groups and teams in ways that actively disrupt systems of power and inequity. Additional Equity-focused Teaching Strategies for Structured Interactions Academic Belonging Academic Belonging is about cultivating students\u2019 sense of connection to and ability to see themselves in the discipline or profession, your course, or a community of scholars (including your class or campus.) Using an equity-focused lens to think about academic belonging means: Actively learning about and addressing patterns of inequity that impact representation and a sense of belonging in your discipline Paying attention to participation patterns in your classroom and intentionally creating new pathways for students to contribute and engage Developing practices that validate prior knowledge as legitimate and necessary as opposed to additive Additional Equity-focused Teaching Strategies for Academic Belonging Transparency Transparency is clearly communicating with students about expectations and norms; explaining purpose, task, and criteria for learning activities.

Testing and grading are linked to the learning objectives of a course and provide ways of gauging student learning. Below we provide information about grading policies and procedures and academic integrity, and we suggest best practices for designing and grading exams, creating grading criteria or rubrics, grading lab reports, and evaluating student writing. Grades at U-M This section explains the grading policies and procedures specific to the University of Michigan, including the timeline for online grade submission and the process for changing grades after submission. Grading and Online Grade Submission On the Ann Arbor campus, grades are due within 72 hours after the scheduled final examination. If there is no exam scheduled for the class, grades are due 72 hours after the last day of the class or 72 hours after the completed work was due for the class. There is no University-wide grading scale, although some units have guidelines or requirements about grading procedures. Please check with your academic unit for information about any policies or procedures that may apply. In general, acceptable letter grades for undergraduates are: Symbol Significance A+, A, A- Excellent B+, B, B- Good C+, C, C- Acceptable D+, D, D- Deficient, but passed E Not passed In addition to the standard A-E grades, there are several special reports you may use: NR (no report) : Used if a student on the grade sheet has attended class not at all or only sporadically, thus providing insufficient basis for a grade. X (missed final) : If the student has completed all course requirements except the final exam, you should report \u201cX\u201d. Reporting \u201cX\u201d does not oblige you to allow a make-up of the final. It only leaves you free to do so, if the student provides an excuse satisfactory to you. Find out your college\u2019s policy regarding the date when the student must complete the final exam. At that time you must submit a revised grade (see \u201cChanging Grades\u201d below). If the student does not complete the final, or if the excuse is unacceptable to you, the \u201cX\u201d will automatically be turned into an \u201cE\u201d on the transcript. I (incomplete) : Find out your college\u2019s policies regarding the assignment of incompletes. Note that submitting an \u201cI\u201d presumes that you have made arrangements for the student to complete the work at a later date. Once you submit the \u201cI\u201d you are obliged to accept and grade the student\u2019s missing work if it is submitted before the college deadline or before an earlier deadline specifically set by you. In cases where a student has not completed the course assignments yet has made no acceptable arrangements with you for late submission of the work, do not bind yourself by submitting an \u201cI\u201d. Use \u201cNR\u201d instead, and if the student subsequently makes satisfactory arrangements with you, the \u201cNR\u201d can be changed to \u201cI\u201d (see \u201cChanging Grades\u201d below). In Fall 2005, the University replaced paper grade rosters with an online system for grade submission on Wolverine Access (http://wolverineaccess.umich.edu/). In June 2008, Teaching Support (the previous name of the online grade submission system) was renamed Faculty Business . Complete information on using Faculty Business may be found at: https://csprod.dsc.umich.edu/htmldoc/eng/dftie/lsaa/htm/sr_fb_facultybusinessmenu.html Departments determine who has access to online grade rosters, for both entering and approving grades. However, a proxy can also be assigned by the instructor(s), also through Faculty Business . Posting Grades and Returning Exams and Papers Some faculty post grades outside of their office or in some other public place. It is important not to post grades by name, social security number, UM ID, or by any method in which students can be identified, because to do so violates the students\u2019 right to privacy. If posting grades, use non-identifiable lists, such as a pre-established code name or number for each student. Please do not leave graded material lying in the hallway or outside your office because this practice violates students\u2019 federal privacy rights under FERPA (for more information please see: https://compliance.umich.edu/topics/education/student-records/ ). In general, it is advisable to return papers and exams to students so that they can see their performance, correct their mistakes, and learn from your comments. If you have specific reasons for not returning a set of papers or exams, you are free to do so, but please announce your policy to the class in advance. If at all possible, return papers and exams in class, electronically to individual students, or during office hours; alternatively, ask students to give you a large self-addressed envelope with adequate postage so that you can return their materials. If you retain papers or exams, you should keep them for a year after the end of the course so that students will still have the opportunity to examine them and to learn from your comments. Saving unreturned papers and exams will also protect you in case a student charges you with improper grading. Disputes regarding grades are handled according to the policy and procedure of the school or college. Your records showing the class grades throughout the term, as well as the final course grades given, should also be retained. If you leave the University, you should leave your grade records with the department for safekeeping along with a mechanism for contacting you if students have questions about their grades. Even if you are only on leave, it is useful if the department has access to your records in order to be able to respond to questions that might arise during your absence. Changing Grades In February 2007, the University implemented an online grade change process to replace the Supplemental Grade Report (SGR) paper-based forms. Please note that grades can be changed only after the grade roster has been posted, and only by an instructor with \u201cApprove\u201d grade roster status or a proxy with \u201cGrade Change\u201d access. Grade changes can be made through Faculty Business via Wolverine Access. Each School/College has different approval rules that are encoded into the system, so please check with your department to see if grade changes must be reviewed and approved by staff. Paper grade change request forms may still be required in cases where there is no electronic grade roster (i.e., pre-2005). Most often grades are changed due to some kind of clerical error or a decision that in retrospect a particular piece of work was graded too low (or too high). Be sure to check with your department to find out the situations in which it is acceptable to change a grade. If the student\u2019s report is \u201cI\u201d (incomplete) or \u201cX\u201d (missed final exam), the work must be completed according to the deadline set by your college; however, your instructional team (i.e., you and the faculty teaching the course) can set an earlier deadline if appropriate. The notation \u201cI\u201d or \u201cX\u201d will remain on the student\u2019s transcript as a sign that the course was completed after the end of the term. In general, but especially with graduating seniors, it is important for you to report the final grade as soon as possible. Academic Integrity Academic integrity Students' ethical development Best Practices for Testing, Measurement, and Grading The links in this section address frequently asked questions about this topic, offer suggestions for constructing exams and test items, describe measurement methods, and offer best practices for grading and providing feedback. Best practices for designing and grading exams : Adapted from CRLT Occasional Paper #24, this page provides an overview of the science of developing valid and reliable exams, especially multiple-choice and essay items. Also described are key issues related to grading: holistic and trait-analytic rubrics, and normative and criterion grading systems. IDEA Paper #16: Improving Multiple Choice Questions (IDEA Center, Clegg & Cashin, 1986) : A very clear, concise overview of the advantages and drawbacks of multiple choice questions, along with a step-by-step guide for item construction. Improving Multiple Choice Questions (University of North Carolina, 1990) : Another overview with a more narrative approach to multiple choice question design, this paper also offers a discussion of analyzing questions for the effectiveness and gives examples of questions designed to test higher level thinking skills. Grading Criteria and Rubrics : A compilation of resources for establishing grading criteria and creating rubrics from the Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning at Brown University. Includes links to sample rubric collections, online rubric generators, and an online tutorial for creating rubrics. Best practices for grading lab reports : This page discusses the purpose of lab reports and offers suggestions for easier grading of lab reports. Evaluating student writing : This page provides links that describe ways to construct and react to assignments based on student written work, including creation of questions, strategies for grading, and ways to respond effectively to student writing. Also included are some resources regarding the use of learning portfolios and e-portfolios.

Graduate students report that colleges and universities often request statements from applicants for faculty positions. Faculty at an increasing number of institutions must develop a teaching statement as they approach tenure and promotion. Instructors at all levels find that writing their statement helps them develop as teachers, since it entails making their implicit views on teaching and student learning explicit and comparing those views to actual teaching practice.

Most of the methods described below can be used for all of these functions. What follows are multiple methods for collecting information about instructors\u2019 activities, accomplishments, and effectiveness in teaching, in the classroom and beyond. While this list includes best practices for using student ratings, it also offers suggestions for ensuring that student ratings are not the only source of evidence used to assess instructional effectiveness, an approach consistent with research. In addition, detailed resources are available on the topics of student ratings of instruction , peer review of teaching , and teaching portfolios and course portfolios . To set up an appointment with a CRLT consultant to discuss teaching evaluation methods, complete our consultation request form . Overviews Improving Your Teaching: Obtaining Feedback This page offers an overview of a variety of methods for obtaining feedback on your teaching, including techniques for soliciting student feedback, for cultivating self-reflection, and for receiving observation and consultation from peers and supervisors. How to Evaluate Teaching (Felder and Brent, 2004) This article offers a brief outline of a process for obtaining a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of a faculty member's teaching using multiple sources of data. Appraising Teaching Effectiveness: Beyond Student Ratings (Hoyt and Pallett, 1999, IDEA Center) This paper describes direct and indirect benefits of several sources for evaluating teaching effectiveness, including ratings from students, colleagues, and the department chair. It also details specific schedules for evaluating different types of teachers, such as first year faculty, non-tenured, and tenured (see p. 6). Evaluation and report templates are found in the appendices. References for Peer Review of Teaching (Cornell University) A list of books and articles for further reading about peer review and teaching evaluation more broadly. Obtaining and Giving Feedback to GSIs (from CRLT Handbook on Departmental GSI Training) This resource discusses several ways faculty coordinators can provide GSIs with feedback on their teaching, both for improvement and for personnel decisions. Evidence That Can Be Collected From Colleagues For resources on many of the following topics, visit CRLT's web page on peer review of teaching . Results of observations of classroom teaching Review of course materials (e.g., syllabi, assignments, rubrics) Review of student work (test, papers, projects), grading criteria that show what students accomplished in the course (e.g., samples of A, B, C work along with a grade distribution; comparisons of student work at the beginning and end of term to document growth) Review of teaching or course portfolios Contributions to course and curricular development Contributions to mentoring students, including student research, honors and MA theses, dissertations Evidence That Can Be Collected From Students Student ratings - CRLT\u2019s web page on student ratings offers information about the U-M online ratings system, overviews of the research on ratings, and advice for using ratings results for improvement or personnel decisions. Early Feedback Form : This page provides a sample feedback form that instructors might distribute to students to solicit anonymous responses and suggestions while a course is in progress. Midterm Student Feedback to provide information for improvement (generally not recommended for personnel decisions unless an instructor chooses to include results in a portfolio) Student letters, solicited from the whole class by the department Examples of student work that show what students accomplished in the course (e.g., samples of A, B, C work along with a grade distribution; comparisons of student work at the beginning and end of term to document growth) Online surveys, such as SurveyMonkey or Qualtrics, designed by individual instructors, departments or units (possibly done as alumni surveys: \u201c\u2026Now that you\u2019ve completed your course\u2026\u201d) Feedback from advisees (including MA and Ph.D. students, as well as undergraduate research assistants) Evidence That Instructors Can Collect on Their Own Reflective statement on a particular course with short sections on the goals of the course, teaching methods used, and the effectiveness of the course in helping students achieve goals Scholarship of teaching and learning projects or other research efforts undertaken to assess student learning Professional development efforts around teaching (e.g., attending workshops and seminars, consultations on teaching, midterm student feedback , etc.) Description of work on curriculum development, GSI training, or other aspects of the department\u2019s educational mission Evaluation of Student Learning (Testing, Grading, Feedback) Teaching Portfolios and Course Portfolios In general, efforts to collect information for improvement can be informal and focus on specific areas an individual instructor wishes to develop. Information for job applications involves presenting one\u2019s best work and meeting the requirements outlined in job ads. However, when the purpose of evaluation is personnel decision making, it is important to use a comprehensive and systematic process. Because there are many dimensions to pedagogical work, it is best to use multiple measures involving multiple sources of data to evaluate the range of instructional activities, which can include the following: Instructional Delivery (including quality, amount, and level of classroom instruction) Course Planning (including development of course materials, course revision, development of new courses Grading and Assessing Student Learning (including appropriate level of assignments, exams, grading standards Course Management (including supervision of GSIs) Oversight of Independent Studies, Honors Theses, Prelims, Dissertations Support for Student Internships, Experiential Learning, Service Learning Department and Curricular Work (including participation in curriculum revision, departmental efforts to focus on teaching) Advising and Mentoring Professional Development and Innovation Around Teaching Faculty, Departmental, and School Responsibilities To ensure that an evaluation system adopted is credible and acceptable, faculty members must have a strong hand in its development. Before departments and schools adopt teaching evaluation systems, faculty should come to consensus on their criteria for effective teaching. Departments and schools can then use these criteria to guide implementation of specific evaluation methods. In general, evaluations systems need to be flexible enough to accommodate diversity in instructional methods used in the department, school, or college (e.g., lecture, discussion, lab, case study, small group interaction, practicum, studio teaching, fieldwork, clinical work, etc.). Chairs, associate deans, or faculty committees can set up an appointment with a CRLT consultant to discuss teaching evaluation methods, by completing our consultation request form .

This interactive in-person workshop provides an opportunity for instructors to think together and work through strategies for engaging with students in the classroom about emerging events on campus and beyond. This session is offered as part of the Promoting Democracy Teaching Series, co-sponsored by CRLT and Ginsberg Center. Open to UM faculty, graduate students/GSIs and post-docs. If you are UM staff with instructional responsibilities who would like to register, please reach out to teachdemocracy@umich.edu Looking for a different faculty workshop?

Whatever the context, it is helpful to structure such discussions in a way that defines boundaries for the process and provides some degree of closure within the classroom. Such discussions are an especially important time to explicitly discuss expectations for respecting a range of perspectives and experiences in the room.\u00a0For guidance specific to discussion of war or international conflict, click here. In addition, this page includes links to guidelines that were developed in the past for topics such as hate speech, cyberbullying, and 9/11. Spontaneous Discussions: Dealing with the Unexpected It is wise to be prepared to respond to the possibility that a student will raise a controversial issue in class unexpectedly. Immediate response is called for, if only to decide what to do next: Acknowledge the student who raised the issue while noting that students may vary in their responses. Decide whether you are ready and willing to engage with the topic right away. Quickly assess whether the class would like to spend time sharing views about the topic. If students want to have a dialogue, and you want to wait on it, schedule a discussion for a later class and suggest ways that students could prepare. For particularly charged, contemporary issues (such as war and conflict), instructors should not feel compelled to lead a discussion, especially if your own emotions or reactions make you hesitant to do so, if you have strong views that would make it difficult to relate to all students, or if you do not consider this discussion an appropriate use of class time. You can make a simple statement to the class to this effect, acknowledge the issue and validate what students are experiencing. This includes expressing concern for their wellbeing and a willingness to work with them if they need accommodations. For more information see the section on discussions of war and conflict, below . Click here for further resources for making the most of 'hot moments' that emerge in your classroom when you do not anticipate them. Planned Discussions on High-Stakes or Controversial Topics Planning a discussion on a controversial topic or issue benefits from consideration of the following topics, each of which is addressed below: Identifying a clear purpose Establishing ground rules Providing a common basis for understanding Creating a framework for the discussion that maintains focus and flow Including everyone Being an active facilitator Summarizing discussion and gathering student feedback Handling issues that involve the instructor\u2019s identity University resources Identifying a clear purpose Starting a discussion with clearly articulated objectives can help shape the nature of the discussion and link it to other course goals. Examples of general objectives include: Connecting the topic with course material, including fundamental concepts and strategies for analysis and thoughtful reflection Increasing awareness about the topic by providing information that is not generally addressed in informal discussions Promoting critical thinking by helping students to understand the complexity of the issues Enhancing skills for dialogue that students can take into other venues Relating classroom discussion to the roles that students have as citizens within the university community\u00a0and larger society More specific objectives for discussion about social conflicts, especially those involving language of hate or bias, may focus on policies, social conventions, or civic responsibilities, including the following: Examining and developing positions on issues of social policy, university policy, or social convention. Identifying a core problem underlying social conflicts and exploring possible answers to the problem. Analyzing the root causes or reasons for a social conflict (i.e., a past-oriented discussion). Exploring possible consequences or implications of a conflict (i.e., a future-oriented discussion). Planning effective actions to reduce such incidents and/or to support vulnerable populations. (This second list is adapted from Ronald Hyman, 1980, In Improving Discussion Leadership .\u00a0 New York: Columbia University, College Teachers Press.) back to the list Establishing ground rules or guidelines In class, instructors can either work with students to generate ground rules or discussion guidelines, or they can present a set of guidelines and then work with students to accept or modify them. Referring back to these community agreements can be very helpful if discussion becomes tense.\u00a0 Some suggestions include the following: Listen respectfully, without interrupting. Listen actively and with an ear to understanding others' views. (Don\u2019t just think about what you are going to say while someone else is talking.) Criticize ideas, not individuals. Commit to learning, not debating. Comment in order to share information, not to persuade. Avoid blame, speculation, and inflammatory language. Allow everyone the chance to speak. Avoid\u00a0assumptions about any member of the class or generalizations about social groups. Do not ask individuals to speak for their (perceived) social group. It is important that students agree on the ground rules before discussion begins. See this page for some further examples and considerations around the use of guidelines . back to the list Providing a common basis for understanding Providing students with a common basis for understanding from the start will help keep the discussion focused and provide concrete case studies or examples.\u00a0 For instance, you can assign readings on a specific conflict, instruct students to select their own readings to bring to class, or show a video clip to prompt discussion. Another option is to have students review materials during class and follow up with a structured discussion. You can also draw upon students' own knowledge to establish a common basis: In class, ask students to identify key points of information, stating their source.\u00a0 (You can ask students to do this individually and then pool the information, or you can simply elicit information from the class as a whole.)\u00a0 Make a list of these for the whole class. Use this elicitation as a time to distinguish evaluative, \u201cloaded,\u201d comments from less evaluative statements, and from statements of personal opinion or experience.\u00a0 Acknowledge how difficult it may be to make these distinctions at times. In order to identify and situate threads of discussion that are extraneous to the focus, or are very speculative, ask for and identify information that students would like to know to clarify their understanding on these questions or tangents, even if that information is not available. back to the list Creating a framework for the discussion that maintains focus and flow Because any social conflict or controversy is a complex topic, it is important to create a framework for the discussion in addition to having clearly defined objectives.\u00a0 Your framework can be a guide, balancing the need to have clear purpose and direction while being open to student observations and interpretation. The following strategies can help you maintain the focus and flow of the discussion: Begin the discussion with clear, open-ended but bounded questions that encourage discussion. Avoid \u201cdouble-barreled questions\u201d which pose two problems simultaneously, or \u201chide the ball\u201d questions that search for a specific answer. Ask questions that prompt multiple answers rather than short factual responses or simple \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d replies. Prepare specific questions to use if the class is silent or hesitant about speaking. Some examples include: \u201cWhat makes this hard to discuss?\u201d and \u201cWhat needs to be clarified at this point?\u201d Encourage students to elaborate upon their comments where needed. With probing questions, an instructor can prompt students to share more specific information, clarify an idea, elaborate on a point, or provide further explanation. Be prepared to re-direct the discussion if students go beyond the intended focus. Drawing attention to the readings or reminding the class about the discussion objectives are useful management techniques. When students raise points that are extraneous to the focus, note that these are important but tangential.\u00a0 Recap them at the end of class as other topics to think about on one\u2019s own, to validate student contributions. Recap the key discussion points or issues at the end of class, in writing if possible. back to the list Including everyone To include all students\u2019 perspectives can be challenging in a whole group discussion, especially if students are dealing with unfamiliar or controversial material.\u00a0\u00a0 Moving beyond a whole group discussion format allows all students to participate and helps prevent the most talkative or opinionated students from dominating the conversation.\u00a0 Using small groups, your class can hear from students who may not speak otherwise, including those who may see their views as marginalized as well as those who want to explore ideas they are not sure about. Some methods for increasing the number of discussants include: The Round :\u00a0 Give each student an opportunity to respond to a guiding question without interruption or comments. Provide students with the option to pass. After the round, discuss the responses. Think-Pair-Share :\u00a0 Give students a few minutes to respond to a question individually in writing. Divide the class into pairs. Instruct the students to share their responses with group members. Provide students with explicit directions, such as \u201cTell each other why you wrote what you did.\u201d After a specified time period, have the class reconvene in order to debrief.\u00a0 You\u00a0can ask for comments on how much their pairs of views coincided or differed, or ask what questions remain after their paired discussion. Sharing Reflection Memos :\u00a0 Prior to the discussion, have students write a reflective memo in response to a question or set of questions that you pose. As part of the discussion, ask students to read their memos, and/or share them in pairs or threes. With each of these methods, the instructor can play an important role of summarizing or synthesizing the various responses and relating them to the discussion objectives. back to the list Being an active facilitator In order to keep a discussion focused and purposeful, it is important to be an active facilitator rather than a passive observer. Be careful to maintain some control but not over-control. Your role as an active facilitator can include rewording questions posed by students, correcting misinformation, making reference to relevant reading materials or course content, asking for clarification, and reviewing main points. Students may expect their instructors to express their own point of view, or they may ask explicitly for this view. In deciding how to respond, instructors should consider their comfort in expressing personal views, and also the impact such expressions will have on this and future discussion in class. For instance, will sharing your perspective usefully model the way one can take a stance on a complex topic, or will it more likely shut down those students who may disagree with you? Or, will your sharing of your perspective helpfully respond to comments that marginalize or devalue students in your class? back to the list Summarizing discussion and gathering student feedback It is very important to save time at the end of class to conclude by summarizing the main points of the discussion. Students are more likely to feel that a discussion was valuable if the instructor, with the help of the class, synthesizes what has been shared or identifies the key issues explored. To obtain student feedback about the quality of the discussion and to identify issues that may need follow-up, you can save the last five minutes of class for students to write a Minute Paper . Ask them to respond to some or all of these questions: What are the three most important points you learned today? What important questions remain unanswered for you? What did you learn specifically from what someone else said that you would not have thought of on your own? Review the student responses before your next meeting with the class. During the next class, briefly summarize the student feedback and thank the students for their participation. back to the list Handling issues that involve the instructor's identity Discussing an issue of social conflict can involve the instructor's identity in a number of ways. Students may make assumptions about the expectations an instructor has in leading the class discussion. Assumptions may be based on the students' perception of the instructor's identity, on the way that the instructor has handled other class sessions, and on their personal interactions with the instructor. In addition, some issues and events may trigger reactive responses in an instructor, and students may say things and speak in ways that trigger emotional reactions.\u00a0 Instructors need to be aware of the possibility (or even the likelihood) of having an emotional response, even if a discussion is thoughtfully planned.\u00a0 Recognizing the response and the trigger as such will help an instructor to stay even-tempered in leading the discussion. To handle statements that trigger emotional responses, instructors will want to draw on techniques that will allow them and the class to step back and gain perspective (e.g., naming the triggering issue, giving oneself time by asking students to do a brief writing exercise, working with the class to reframe or contextualize the triggering statement).\u00a0 If an instructor needs to let such a moment simply pass by, it is important to find time later to talk through the experience, and to address the triggering issue with others who are outside of the class. In the event that one or more students try to draw the instructor into an emotional response, the ground rules for discussion can play a vital role, and the instructor can model constructive behavior in demonstrating how to unpack such a heated moment by reviewing what had led up to it, in pointing out differences between baiting, debating, and discussing, and/or steering the discussion into a more useful direction. back to the list Issues to consider before discussing wars and other international conflicts For certain groups of students, there is a potential for backlash during class discussions. It is important that students not be doubly hurt as a result of discussion - first by effects of a war or conflict, and second by misguided generalizations. Students may have very different interpretations of a given war or conflict, its causes and its potential outcomes. It is important to allow students to express these differences without fear of ridicule or attack, while also encouraging disagreement, which is a cornerstone of critical thinking and part of the academy's long tradition of intellectual inquiry. Some individuals have a special and complicated relationship to a war given their own connections or those of family and friends. For example, discussions about the war may be especially difficult for faculty and students from certain groups, including the following: Those from areas impacted by the war and those who have close connections to the war-impacted areas International faculty and students, who may be viewed or treated differently during a crisis Members of groups that some are blaming for a current crisis Those personally connected to the U.S. armed forces, including those in the campus ROTC program and those with family and friends in the armed forces Instructors should not feel compelled to lead a discussion, especially if your own emotions or reactions make you hesitant to do so, if you have strong views that would make it difficult to relate to all students, or if you do not consider this discussion an appropriate use of class time. You can make a simple statement to the class to this effect, and then move on. It can also be helpful to acknowledge the impact of the situation on students and your willingness to work with them for any accommodations that might be necessary. back to the list University Resources To discuss additional strategies or concerns, contact CRLT consultants by phone (734-764-0505), by email ( crlt@umich.edu ), or in person (1071 Palmer Commons).

You could be thinking of short group activities completed in-class. You might be thinking of large group projects. You might be thinking of teams that work together over a semester or ad hoc groups formed with each activity. While there is overlap, each of these approaches to collaborative work has its own set of considerations. We designed these pages so you can dive into the type of collaborative work that best fits your inquiry. Informal, In-class Group Activities : we discuss activities where temporary groups address a single question or problem in a short timeframe. In-class Group Activities with Standing Groups or Teams : we look at collaborative work where the relationships are more formalized, with the same team returning to work with each other on in-class activities throughout the course. Project-based Groups or Teams : we dedicate our attention to groups working on large projects over extended time frames, often partially or completely outside of class time. You may want to learn more about the benefits of collaborative work more generally. We encourage you to investigate our page Why Learn in Teams and Groups? After exploring these resources, you may still have questions about group work and how to implement it in your specific teaching context. We encourage you to reach out and schedule a one-on-one consultation . Print Groups and Teams Teaching Strategies: Introduction to Groups and Teams Why learn in teams and groups?

In the traditional lecture-based approach, students gain first exposure to new concepts by attending class and listening to lecture. While instructors expect students to do the reading in advance, preparation can be minimal: students know that the material will be covered in lecture. Instructors assign homework for students to complete outside of class to practice and deepen their understanding of the material. Homework often exposes student questions and gaps in knowledge, but the instructor is not available to help students. In the \u201cflipped classroom,\u201d class time is devoted to engaged learning. Students are actually doing the \u201chomework\u201d (practice, application, and analysis of concepts) in class, often in collaboration with peers, and they can get help from their instructor and from peers as their questions arise.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, students are expected to gain first exposure to concepts through readings or by watching videos before class, and they are held accountable for that pre-class work to ensure they prepare. The figure below contrasts traditional lectures with a flipped classroom. At each of the links in the left sidebar, you can find more information about the components of a flipped class or see how faculty at U-M are flipping their classes. LSA Instructional Support Services (LSA-Technology Support) has additional resources for flipping a class on their webpage.

Here at CRLT, we have made a shift to focus from inclusion to equity-focused teaching because we recognize the need to be more responsive to the impact of systemic inequities on teaching and learning. As scholarship continues to advance in our fields, we have recognized that most well-intentioned inclusion-focused practices do not and will not by themselves disrupt histories of inequity. Inclusion focused practices are not necessarily outcomes-focused or attendant to histories of disenfranchisement; they can sometimes obscure power differences in the classroom in the name of \u2018inclusion\u2019. While our consultants have always had equity in mind, the recent shift in language and practice grounds our work within a definition that centers relationships of power. Our new focus gives instructors more direct guidance on what equity-focused teaching is intended to do: disrupt systems of privilege and disadvantage, and acknowledge a shared responsibility amongst instructors and students for re-thinking and changing patterns of educational disenfranchisement. Click to view timeline of equity-focused teaching definition evolution at CRLT. Defining Equity-Focused Teaching Equity-Focused Teaching is a corrective tool that allows instructors to acknowledge and disrupt historical and contemporary patterns of educational disenfranchisement that often negatively impact marginalized and minoritized students. It recognizes that systemic inequities shape all students\u2019 individual and group-based experiences of social identity and produce vastly different relationships of power in and outside of the classroom, which impact students\u2019 learning and success. The corrective work of equity-focused teaching involves deliberately cultivating a learning environment where students: Have equal access to learning Feel valued and supported in their learning Experience parity in achieving positive course outcomes Share responsibility for the equitable engagement and treatment of all in the learning community. Equity-Focused teaching is an ongoing commitment and practice that should develop across the life of a teaching career. This commitment is always in the service of achieving just experiences and outcomes for both students and teachers alike. CRLT provides training opportunities and individual and unit consultation on equitable and inclusive teaching year-round.

Graduate students report that colleges and universities often request statements from applicants for faculty positions. Faculty at an increasing number of institutions must develop a teaching statement as they approach tenure and promotion. Instructors at all levels find that writing their statement helps them develop as teachers, since it entails making their implicit views on teaching and student learning explicit and comparing those views to actual teaching practice.

The term \u201cactive learning\u201d is certainly not a new one. It has become increasingly common amongst college classrooms in recent years. The result has been a tremendous amount of research on the topic. Numerous studies have supported the benefits of active learning in regard to its impact on teaching and student learning. Researchers and faculty have interpreted it in various ways. Michael Prince explains, \u201cActive learning is generally defined as any instructional method that engages students in the learning process. In short, active learning requires students to do meaningful learning activities and think about what they are doing\u201d (Prince, 2004) . Prince\u2019s definition is drawn from foundational work done by Bonwell and Eison ( Bonwell, 2000 and Eison, 2010 ) and has been widely accepted. Active Learning vs. Engaged Learning Instructors sometimes ask how active learning is related to \u201cengaged learning.\u201d At the University of Michigan, engaged learning is defined as the education experiences in which \u201cstudents have opportunities to practice in unscripted, authentic settings, where stakeholders (including the students themselves) are invested in the outcome.\u201d For more information about engaged learning at U-M, visit Engaged Learning at Michigan . What Does Active Learning Look Like in the Classroom? In a course focused on active learning, students are truly engaged in the learning process. They might be grappling with the course material by working collaboratively on problems. They are constantly processing what they are learning. Students may look at PowerPoint slides, but they are also discussing or debating questions posed by the instructor and are asked to critically analyze the information presented. They may search the Internet, but they are looking for data and resources to support their arguments. In some cases, they are exposed to an extensive amount of material outside of class so that most of the in-class time can be devoted to hands-on learning (see examples of First Exposure to Course Content ).\u00a0In fact, some courses are so active that an outside observer might not be able to immediately identify who the instructor is, as the instructor\u00a0might be circulating and interacting with groups of working students. Benefits of Active Learning The benefits of active learning have been supported time and again in the literature. By comparing student learning gains in introductory physics courses, Richard Hake was able to show that interactive courses were over two times as effective in promoting conceptual understanding as compared to traditional ones (Hake, 1998) . A more recent meta-analysis by Freeman et al. reported results from 225 studies across STEM disciplines, comparing traditional lecture to active learning (Freeman, 2014) . In general, students\u2019 average exam scores were shown to improve by around 6% in active learning classes. Additionally, students involved in traditional lecture were found to be 1.5 times more likely to fail as compared to those in classes with significant active learning. It takes time and creativity to effectively incorporate active learning strategies into teaching and achieve the full benefits across instructional settings and disciplines. But as many of the faculty members we profile demonstrate, active learning can easily and effectively be incorporated into existing courses and materials without the need for a dramatic overhauling of the course. This website focuses on the following: reflecting on your own practice to\u00a0identify areas in which active learning could be used, and identifying strategies already being used that can be built upon making active learning work -- tips and techniques for integrating active learning strategies while avoiding common pitfalls U-M faculty examples of how active learning strategies are integrated in teaching resources for further exploration, including discipline-specific resources and the research that supports our conclusions about the efficacy of active learning. Reflect on your own teaching, explore our faculty examples, and plan to engage students in the learning process. As always, CRLT has a variety of resources, from our blog to one-on-one consultations, to support you. How Can You Incorporate Active Learning Into Your Classroom? (pdf): This document provides a considerable list of strategies to foster active learning in the classroom. This document is useful for instructors looking for ways to boost students' engagement and understanding or for activities to build into a lesson plan.

As part of this collaboration, we are refreshing our guidance from recent presidential elections. While many of the strategies in our earlier entries remain as best practices, this updated piece also reflects our ongoing efforts on the topic, adapted for the current political environment. The 2024 Presidential Election is fast approaching, and students and faculty alike will be highly impacted by both election rhetoric and election outcomes. On university campuses, protests and speech around the war in Gaza have added more tension to an already fraught election. Important dialogues around issues like climate change, women\u2019s rights, immigration, and the economy can cultivate a civic-minded society, but they also make election seasons complex and challenging times for teaching. Nevertheless, U-M's mission to \"develop leaders and citizens who will challenge the present and enrich the future\" reminds us of the incredible opportunity instructors have to harness the momentum of each election season for student learning and democratic engagement. For these reasons, we encourage all instructors to be prepared by proactively thinking about how the 2024 Election may impact their students, their classrooms, and themselves. While U-M instructors and staff cannot advocate for candidates or ballot initiatives, they can encourage student voting and engagement with election issues ( see these guidelines and FAQs from U-M\u2019s General Counsel ). Below, we offer reflective questions and nonpartisan resources designed to help instructors and staff think about opportunities to promote democratic and civic engagement in their courses, while considering and preparing for the high stakes of election-related discussions for their students and themselves. As always, CRLT and the Ginsberg Center consultants are available to talk with any instructor about planning courses or class sessions -- or responding to difficult moments if they arise. You can make an appointment through CRLT\u2019s website or use the Ginsberg Center\u2019s Support Request Form . How can I connect my course or discipline to the election and issues raised by it? We encourage instructors to start with course and disciplinary connections to the election because it supports students and instructors in a number of ways including: Promoting Student Voting: Students are more likely to vote when they feel confident they have the knowledge and skills to critically evaluate the platforms of candidates. In fact, research suggests that universities with the highest levels of student political participation prioritize regular classroom discussions about policy, current events, and political issues across the disciplines ( Thomas and Brower, 2017 ). Whether the topic is health care, systemic racial inequities, education, immigration and the rights of refugees, fracking or climate change, gender inequality and LGBTQ+ rights, or international relations\u2014every discipline provides opportunities for students to practice skills they need to weigh the issues raised by the election. Facilitating Constructive Dialogue: In these Guidelines for Discussing Difficult or High-Stakes Topics , we recommend that instructors start by identifying a clear purpose for the election-related discussion or activity, tied to your course topics and goals. This step, along with providing lots of structure and careful facilitation, gives students space to process what\u2019s happening in the world, while establishing parameters or bounds around the conversation. This can help students move through disagreement and emotion. Anchoring in Academic Expertise: Instructors also benefit from this approach to discussing elections. By centering election discussions in their disciplinary knowledge and epistemologies, instructors can guide conversations with greater confidence and share insights from their expertise. In our Identifying and Strengthening Course Connections reflection, you will find questions and helpful resources for identifying intersections between the election (and issues raised by the election) and your course or discipline. You will also find a set of follow-up reflection questions on strengthening and clarifying the link to your course learning objectives for you and\u2014importantly\u2014your students. On the Strategies to Support Civic & Democratic Engagement in Courses page, you can also find a rich set of reflection questions to identify course and disciplinary connections. Take the opportunity to explore strategies for connecting your course(s) to the election and the issues, engage with cross-disciplinary examples, and generate ideas for your own teaching at the Connecting Your Course to the 2024 Election workshop ( Sept. 26 ) in the Promoting Democracy Teaching Series . Open to U-M faculty, graduate students, and post-docs. How might my courses allow students to practice some of the fundamental skills required by democracy? In CRLT\u2019s regular programming around course design and lesson planning, we always encourage instructors to start with their student learning goals. When it comes to democratic and civic engagement, our advice is quite similar. When an instructor homes in on their specific goals for integrating election topics into a course or class session, these goals can guide their decision making and provide a clear target of success. In this handout \u2013 Your \u2018Why\u2019 for Election, Civic, & Democratic Engagement \u2013 you can explore a comprehensive set of specific goals for discussing the election and issues raised by the election, organized into three categories. We\u2019d like to delve a little deeper into the last category: goals that support students\u2019 long-term civic engagement. Particularly amidst powerful public examples of vitriol, classroom communities can help students practice informed and responsible participation in dialogue with people whose ideas and viewpoints differ from their own. Regardless of your course topic, you can help your students begin to practice habits of mind that allow them to engage critically and learn from unfamiliar perspectives--habits that are important for their participation in democracy. In addition to the content of our individual disciplines and courses, there are overarching democratic skills that students can develop in courses across the University. These include: The ability to engage in respectful discourse and thoughtful argumentation The capacity to speak and listen in ways that promote collective learning and advance social good The ability to evaluate bias, evidence, and misinformation in text, discourse, and other mediums You don\u2019t need to start from scratch or redesign your course to support this skill building. You can explore ideas for civic learning and democratic engagement , organized by how much time you have to dedicate in class. Step-by-step civic learning activity guides are ready to be adapted and implemented into your teaching context. Using the versatile Deliberative Dialogue framework and prompts , students have a structure to explore differing positions on important issues. The prompts and curated artworks in the Dialogue Deck can foster conversation and reflection on political and social norms in the US, while also providing an opportunity for students to examine their own beliefs and values and explore their origins. Lastly, partners across campus have created exciting opportunities for students to develop and practice skills for civic engagement. You can share these opportunities with your students, encourage them to participate, or incorporate them into your course plan.

The \u201cHey, We Need to Talk\u201d Exhibit and its Common Sense Diner at UMMA Cinematic Democracy: Films Screenings for Civic Engagement hosted by the U-M Library . How can I prepare for the high-stakes conditions that come with teaching during an election season? The high stakes of the 2024 Election are deeply felt by both students and instructors. Moreover, the outcomes of the election will impact us differently, depending our identities and positionality. Even before election day, students and instructors whose identities are repeatedly targeted or negatively represented can feel unsafe, unwelcome, and drained emotionally and intellectually by election rhetoric. This can emerge in classroom discussions and activities about the election as well. As we prepare to teach in this moment, consider what is at risk for students during a classroom conversation about the election. For example: Students may perceive that there will be academic consequences for sharing their perspectives. Students may feel vulnerable as the discussions surface their deeply held beliefs, political positions, and personal experiences. Students\u2019 relationships with each other and their instructors can be impacted by difficult discussions. Students\u2019 sense of belonging in the classroom, discipline, and at U-M can be eroded when their perspectives are not recognized or when sweeping or incorrect statements are made about communities to which they belong. Of course, we have also highlighted some of the valuable benefits to these classroom experiences if facilitated well: they may build students\u2019 motivation and confidence as voters; contribute to course learning; build skills that are crucial to a democracy and civic life; and provide a space to process what\u2019s happening in the world. With the stakes and potential benefits in mind, we encourage instructors to lay the groundwork now for classroom discussions on election topics. This may include establishing and regularly highlighting discussion guidelines for your course , which foster a respectful community and set-up ground rules for productive discussions. It also includes using structured activities for discussions , rather than a more open or informal approach. Another way to prepare is to review and keep on-hand a list of open-ended discussion questions to support your facilitation of high-stakes discussions. To learn more about these strategies within a framework for designing high stakes discussions, join us at a Framing & Facilitating High Stakes Discussions: Election Edition workshop on Sept. 17 or Oct. 21 in the Promoting Democracy Teaching Series. Open to U-M faculty, graduate students, and post-docs. In this political moment, discussions and instruction related to the Middle East and the War in Gaza can be particularly high stakes for many of our students. Hear from panels of experienced U-M instructors on this topic at the Addressing Antisemitism in Teaching session ( Sept. 25 ) and Addressing Anti-Palestinian, Anti-Arab, & Anti-Muslim Racism in Teaching session ( Oct. 10 ) of the CRLT Seminar Series. Open to U-M faculty, graduate students, and post-docs. Even when we design discussions and activities related to election issues in advance, there is always the possibility of unexpected eruptions of tension, conflict, or big emotion. Even though these hot moments may occur unexpectedly, we can still prepare for the possibility by strengthening our facilitation skills and by practicing language to use in these moments. Set aside time to start this work in community with other instructors at a Making the Most of 'Hot Moments': Election Edition workshop on Sept. 20 or Nov. 8 . Open to U-M faculty, graduate students, and post-docs. How can I support student voting? Studies show that encouragement from faculty, staff, and other students makes a significant difference to student registration and turnout ( Bennion & Nickerson , 2016; DellaVigna, List, Malmendier & Rao , 2016; Gerber & Rogers , 2009). There are simple, quick ways you can support student voting , including: Share the UMICH Vote link\u2013 govote.umich.edu \u2013in your syllabus and refer students to UMICH Votes as U-M\u2019s trusted resource for voting, voter registration, and election information. Share up-to-date information about voting using the Ginsberg Center's pre-designed voting announcements slide deck for classrooms, based on UMICH Votes' system of messaging. Share vote411.org or BallotReady links in your syllabus\u2013they give a nonpartisan overview of all upcoming elections and what's on the ballot nationwide Discuss your own voting plan about when and where you will vote, and encourage students to make their own . Turn Up Turnout (TUT), a nonpartisan student organization sponsored by the Ginsberg Center, is a reliable source for voting information at U-M with a strong commitment to getting out the student vote. You can support student voting by sharing their work this fall: Highlight TUT\u2019s voter registration tables on campus. Invite them to share voting information in your class . Show your students this 7-minute 2024 voting information video , created by TUT to share information like: who can vote, how old you need to be to register, what address you can register from, registering in Michigan if you are from out of state, when you can vote in person and by mail, what ID and documentation you need to vote, and more! Coordinate a Walk to the Polls for your unit or department, or share this opportunity with students for their student organizations. U-M is fortunate to have two campus voting hubs where students can pose their questions to trained peer mentors, explore nonpartisan voting resources, and take advantage of a pop-up office of the Ann Arbor City Clerk for registration and voting in the City of Ann Arbor. Bring your class to explore the resources and installations\u2014and even make a button!\u2014 at the UMMA Campus Voting Hub or the Duderstadt Center Gallery Campus Voting Hub.

Each workshop offers opportunities to engage with colleagues from across the university and to think through a range of timely equity-focused teaching questions, challenges, and strategies. You are welcome to register for one or all of the workshops in this one-week series. Sessions are free and open to U-M instructors in any field. This year\u2019s series focuses on \u201chot topics,\u201d recurring questions, and common challenges that instructors have encountered this year. We\u2019ve consulted with many instructors about how to implement Equity-focused Teaching strategies within the context of a teaching team; two workshops (one for faculty and one for GSIs) will be dedicated to this set of issues. \u201cTeaching in Tumultuous Times\u201d looks ahead to the potential impact of the upcoming election season on teaching and learning experiences. CRLT in Engineering will host a workshop on neurodiversity and neurodivergence. Additional workshops will focus on accessibility and critical reflection, equity-focused assessment, Generative AI, journal-keeping as a teaching tool, and facilitating discussions. The program will also include the launch of a summer book study group focused on Robin Wall Kimmerer\u2019s Braiding Sweetgrass. Workshops will take place either in-person (at CRLT in Palmer Commons or on North campus) or via Zoom.
