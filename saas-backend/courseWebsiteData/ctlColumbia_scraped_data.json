Learn More What Our CTL Faculty are Saying Don\u2019t just take it from us, let our fans do the talking! \u201c[The CTL\u2019s] workshop on inclusive teaching shared many strategies for building rapport with students, addressing all students in the classroom, and [reflecting on] my own beliefs and how they impact the classroom experience. The workshop on teaching large classrooms introduced me to a myriad of approaches to interactive and student-centered learning activities. The interactive nature of the workshops made them experiential learning events for me.\u201d Karen Desjardins Associate Professor of Nursing at CUIMC , Director of the Master\u2019s Direct Entry to Nursing Program \u201cOne of the most valuable parts of the experience was talking with the observer before the visit to articulate my goals \u2013 just having to describe the class, what I thought was working well and what I could improve, to someone else helped me to see things I had not noticed before, or had noticed but not articulated. [I received] lots of really manageable suggestions for how to make changes in line with my goals, some of which I was able to implement right away. We are all always growing and learning as teachers, but these little interventions helped me to grow more and faster, and reflect more actively on my teaching and how I want to grow.\u201d Amy Starecheski Co-Director , Columbia Oral History MA Program \u201cAs someone who has taught in the college classroom for about 10 years, it was important to me to have a sort of \u2018refresher\u2019 and receive some honest and articulate feedback from a knowledgeable source; the CTL offers just that. Having a member of the CTL observe me made me feel comfortable because I trust them as experts of pedagogical practices. The [teaching observation] process is robust and complete \u2013 from a pre-meeting through the observation to the post-meeting \u2013 and this makes it worthwhile. This observation helped me to learn new strategies to ensure that I reach all of my students effectively.\u201d Kevin Visconti Lecturer in Strategic Communication , School of Professional Studies Contact the FPS Team Don\u2019t Be Shy.

Students as Pedagogical Partners Initiative On this page: About the Students as Pedagogical Partners Initiative Partnership Opportunities Resources Developed by Former CTL Student Consultants About the Students as Pedagogical Partners Initiative Student-faculty partnerships are intended to promote engaged learning, create more inclusive learning environments, and transform teaching and learning at Columbia. This initiative draws on models at other universities and the literature on pedagogical partnerships . While partnering with faculty to co-create learner-centered and inclusive classrooms, students increase their self-awareness and feel empowered to play an active role in their learning. Faculty learn from the students\u2019 experiences and perspectives which in turn informs their own practices in meeting their students where they are. Partnership Opportunities Ask your students! Are you a Columbia instructor wondering what your students think about particular engagement, assessment, or inclusion strategies? The use of instructional technologies to support their learning? How students might respond to a project or assignment? Or any other input on a class you are teaching? Ask your students for feedback! Seeking student input is good practice. Consider collecting early and mid-semester student feedback from your students and use the information to start a dialogue about their learning in your course. Provost\u2019s Teaching and Learning Grants The Office of the Provost provides funding opportunities for faculty looking to integrate new educational methods or technologies into their classrooms. Consider adding undergraduate students to your funded innovative project team! As part of the proposal, you can request funds within the project budget to compensate undergraduate student(s) of your choosing to assist with designing or redesigning syllabi, modules, assignments, activities, the creation or curation of course materials, etc. For these funded faculty-student partnerships, the CTL will provide support to the project team and professional development to the student(s). Have questions about faculty-student partnership opportunities? Email the CTL at ctlfaculty@columbia.edu. Past Offerings Between Spring 2020 and 2023, the CTL worked with a cohort of Columbia undergraduate students from Columbia College, General Studies, and the School of Engineering and Applied Science, to partner with and bring them into conversations about teaching and learning with faculty. Over the semesters, CTL student consultants have shared their experiences and reflections on being learners at Columbia with our teaching community. You can read more in the Resources Developed by Student Consultants section, and listen to them share their experiences in episodes of the Dead Ideas in Teaching and Learning podcast .

It\u2019s helpful to read the research behind the statistics mentioned in teaching workshops, become conversant educational research, and learn from my peers. We\u2019ve built a community over the semester and I\u2019ve heard from several other graduate students that they would like to participate in the future.\u201d Franziska Landes PhD student in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences , CTL CIRTL Fellow \u201cRunning a Learning Community was one of the more empowering aspects of the Senior Lead Teaching Fellowship. We got the chance to combine our real-world classroom experience with research into some of the latest pedagogical strategies\u2014many I didn\u2019t know of, but now plan on applying in my future teaching, too. In this sense it was really an experience of growth\u2014digging deep into a new area of pedagogy, but also learning how to become an educator about education. Going forward, I now feel confident that I can speak to colleagues outside of my department and beyond about innovative pedagogies that can transform their classroom.\u201d Evan Jewell PhD student in Classical Studies , CTL Senior Lead Teaching Fellow \u201cAs a graduate student and instructor at Columbia, I found in the CTL a truly supportive and committed community that enabled me to enhance my teaching performance and polish my profile and skills for the job market. CTL workshops provided me with the space to rehearse, practice, and develop my pedagogical strategies while also nurturing and strengthening my vision of the role of teachers and their outreach in our society. The CTL community provided me with the skills needed to embrace the job market and land a tenure track position in my field.\u201d Mariana-Cecilia Vel\u00e1zquez PhD student in Latin American and Iberian Cultures , CTL Lead Teaching Fellow Contact the GSPS Team Don\u2019t Be Shy.

Learn More What Our CTL Faculty and Graduate Instructors Are Saying Don\u2019t just take it from us, let our fans do the talking! \u201cThe most valuable part of my mid-course review was that it was such a supportive experience for both me and my students. The students felt really comfortable expressing their views about the course, and they were grateful to be able to have an impact on the class going forward. [CTL\u2019s] Ian Althouse gave me a detailed breakdown of what the students appreciated and what they were unclear about\u2014this allowed me to revisit in more detail an activity that had gotten mixed responses in last semester\u2019s teaching evaluations. I was able to adjust the activity and I really feel confident about it now.\u201d Alana Hein PhD Student , Department of History \u201cMy advice to professors who are considering introducing active learning into their classroom is don\u2019t be afraid. Seek out advice. Go and watch other professors who are using it in their classroom so you can see it in action. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to imagine what it\u2019s going to look like until you\u2019ve seen it. Just be brave, go for it.\u201d Mary Ann Price Lecturer in the Discipline , Department of Biological Sciences \u201cHaving two trained observers watch me for an entire lecture provided valuable feedback that validated my teaching practices, and watching a recording of myself made me aware of various idiosyncrasies that crop up when I\u2019m teaching. The most valuable aspect of the observation was having an objective third party share their honest opinion of my teaching. The positive critiques increased my confidence in how I structure and implement class sessions, while the negative critiques gave me specific aspects of my teaching style to improve.\u201d Richard Townsend PhD Student , Computer Science Contact the CTL Don\u2019t Be Shy.

Inclusive Teaching and Learning Online With the rapid shift to online learning, instructors can draw on principles of inclusive teaching to help students feel a sense of belonging, ensure they can access course materials, and support them in achieving learning goals. The current context calls for empathy and resilience on the part of both students and instructors. Pronouns in Our Community: A Guide From the Office of University Life The Office of University Life has designed this resource to help students, faculty, and staff familiarize themselves with pronoun use by transgender and nonbinary students, faculty and staff at Columbia. Note : Students are able to register their pronouns on You@Columbia in CourseWorks. You can find step by step instructions from CUIT on using You@Columbia in CourseWorks. Teaching in Times of Stress and Challenge Emotions play a vital role in teaching and learning and it is especially important to be responsive to the vast range of emotions that may surface in the classroom during challenging times. This resource offers strategies for teaching during times of stress and highlights campus supports available to help you and your students navigate challenges. Inclusive Teaching: Supporting All Students in the College Classroom MOOC In June 2019, the Columbia CTL launched the first ever MOOC (massive open online course) dedicated entirely to the topic of inclusive teaching in higher education. The MOOC, titled Inclusive Teaching: Supporting All Students in the College Classroom, provides practical, accessible, and usable strategies that instructors can implement in their classrooms to create and maintain a supportive learning environment for all students. The self-paced course is open to all. Teaching Resources and Guides Alternative Grading Approaches: Grading for Learning This resource presents alternative grading approaches with a focus on student learning. Implementing an alternative approach involves rethinking in assessment design and communication with students, such as sharing clearly defined assessment standards, providing timely feedback, indicating ongoing progress for students, and allowing opportunities for reassessment. The intent is to maximize student learning, reduce the stress induced by grades (both for students and for the instructors doing the grading), and ensure that all learners are assessed equitably. Anti-Racist Pedagogy in Action: First Steps Classrooms serve as microcosms of the larger society, and the resources offered here, while focused on pedagogical practices, support broader commitments to anti-racist actions in higher education. This resource centers on citing the experts in this field, synthesizing their work to encourage further research and, most importantly, amplifying the voices of those who have been doing this work for decades. Assessing Equitably with All Learners in Mind The assessment of student learning is an important aspect of any course. The diversity of learners and course contexts necessitates that we question whether our current assessment practices are serving us: do they meet the needs of all of our students? Do they align with our course learning objectives and promote learning for all students? Through a process of reflection on our assessment approaches, we can recognize and remove barriers to student success and work toward more equitable learning experiences for all students.\u200b Blended Learning What is blended learning? What are the benefits to a blended learning approach? What are some strategies for getting started? This resource helps instructors answer these questions by describing the elements of an effective, learner-centered \u201cblend\u201d derived from research and evidence-based practices. In addition, it offers questions that instructors can reflect on before designing their course and additional references and resources. This resource is particularly useful to faculty applying for the Provost\u2019s Hybrid Learning Course Redesign and Delivery grant program and similar requests for proposals. Case Method Case Method is an active learning approach to teaching and learning in which students apply course content and grapple with real or imagined scenarios. Case Method teaching can help students develop more complex skills such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation. This resource provides an overview of the what, why and how of teaching with cases. Instructors new to case method teaching are introduced to different approaches to teaching with cases, where to find cases, and can explore examples of successful Case Method Teaching at Columbia University. Classroom Assessment Techniques (CATs): Low-Stakes Strategies to Assess Active Learning The CTL resource Getting Started with Active Learning offers a framework for active learning in which instructors have students encounter new information, engage with course content, and reflect on what they learned and their learning process. As with any learning activity implemented in a class session, checking what and how students learned from an active learning method is a critical next step to ensure that students have met the learning objectives you set for them. This resource introduces classroom assessment techniques (CATs) as a way to assess what students have learned from active learning methods. Considerations for AI Tools in the Classroom Given the rapid pace of technological innovation and development, higher education, like nearly all industries, is continuously called upon to consider creative approaches to teaching and learning. The following resource offers instructors a brief introduction to AI Tools, specifically ChatGPT, along with several strategies they might consider for navigating or engaging with these tools in their courses. Contemplative Pedagogy Contemplative Pedagogy is an approach to teaching and learning with the goal of encouraging deep learning through focused attention, reflection, and heightened awareness. Learners are encouraged to engage deeply with course material through contemplation and introspection. This resource provides strategies for helping instructors build in opportunities for students to develop deeper understandings of course material. Dead Ideas in Teaching and Learning Dead Ideas in Teaching and Learning is a podcast hosted by CTL executive director, Catherine Ross. In each episode, instructors, students, and leaders in higher education are invited to share their discoveries of \u201cdead ideas\u201d in teaching and learning\u2014ideas that are not true but that are often widely believed and embedded in the pedagogical choices we make. Designing Assignments for Learning The rapid shift to remote teaching and learning meant that many instructors reimagined their assessment practices.\u00a0 This resource distills the elements of assignment design that are important to carry forward as we continue to seek better ways of assessing learning and build on our innovative assignment designs.

Five Tips for Engaged Lecturing Designing a class session is about planning experiences that maximize student learning. The following five tips emphasize the importance of keeping the focus on the students\u2019 experience and what they should be doing during a lecture. Getting Started with Active Learning Active learning strategies involve students not just in doing things, but also thinking about what they are doing. Intentionally incorporating active learning strategies can benefit student learning, and when done inclusively, can also narrow achievement gaps for traditionally underrepresented students. This resource introduces you to a holistic active learning framework as well as Columbia-supported instructional technologies that you can use to design both synchronous and asynchronous activities to engage your students in active learning. Getting Started with Creative Assignments Creative teaching and learning can be cultivated in any course context to increase student engagement and motivation, and promote thinking skills that are critical to problem solving and innovation. This resource features examples of Columbia faculty who teach creatively and have reimagined their course assessments to allow students to demonstrate their learning in creative ways. Drawing on these examples, this resource provides suggestions for creating a classroom environment that supports student engagement in creative activities and assignments. Incorporating Generative AI in Teaching and Learning: Faculty Examples Across Disciplines Faculty across Columbia University are reimagining their course policies, assignments, and activities to refocus on student learning and transparently communicate expectations to their students about the use of generative AI. In what follows, faculty across disciplines provide a glimpse into their approaches as they experiment with AI in their classrooms and teach AI literacy to their students. Incorporating Rubrics Into Your Feedback and Grading Practices This resource provides an overview of the benefits of rubrics, includes strategies to help integrate them into teaching practice, and introduces a few Columbia tools to support rubric design and use. Learning Through Discussion Discussions can be meaningful and engaging learning experiences: dynamic, eye-opening, and generative. However, like any class activity, they require planning and preparation. Without that, discussion challenges can arise in the form of unequal participation, unclear learning outcomes, or low engagement. This resource presents key considerations in class discussions and offers strategies for how instructors can prepare and engage in effective classroom discussions. Learning Through Writing in the Age of AI Introducing students to disciplinary writing in its various forms is essential, yet it can be challenging to balance how much instruction and guidance is needed, and at what scale. At the same time, the introduction of Generative AI has necessitated new approaches to writing assignments. The following resource looks at why writing activities are beneficial for instructors and students alike, and offers some considerations and strategies for writing activities in the age of AI. Leveraging Annotation Activities and Tools to Promote Collaborative Learning Collaborative annotation activities support learning by encouraging students to learn with and from their peers. Research has shown that a collaborative learning environment can help strengthen student confidence, as well as foster their critical thinking skills and active engagement in learning. The following resource offers an overview of some of the benefits of collaborative annotation, as well as specific tools and sample activities to help facilitate this collaboration. Metacognition Resource Metacognitive thinking skills are important for instructors and students alike. This resource provides instructors with an overview of the what and why of metacognition and general \u201cgetting started\u201d strategies for teaching for and with metacognition. Navigating Heated, Offensive, and Tense (HOT) Moments in the Classroom \u200bRegardless of course topic or content, challenging conversations, moments of rupture or disruption, and heated encounters may occur in the classroom. Though they are complicated and can be difficult to respond to, there are steps instructors can take to anticipate and navigate HOT\u2014heated, offensive, or tense\u2014moments before, during, and after they occur. This resource provides strategies that can be implemented in any course context. Peer Review: Intentional Design for Any Course Context This resource offers a number of considerations for instructors developing peer review activities in their classes. While there are specific platforms that can help facilitate peer review in online or hybrid classes, considerations remain the same across different class formats (e.g.: in-person, hybrid (HyFlex), online). Getting Started with Project-Based Learning Project-based learning (PBL) actively involves students in their learning and prepares them for the world beyond the classroom. This resource offers an introductory overview of PBL, including the key features and questions for reflection as instructors develop their project-based teaching practices. Promoting Academic Integrity While it is each student\u2019s responsibility to understand and abide by university standards towards individual work and academic integrity, instructors can help students understand their responsibilities through frank classroom conversations that go beyond policy language to shared values. By creating a learning environment that stimulates engagement and designing assessments that are authentic, instructors can minimize the incidence of academic dishonesty.

Faculty, graduate students, postdocs, and staff can get advice, training, and support to experiment with a rich portfolio of online platforms and digital and media tools to turn classrooms into active spaces for learning. On this page: Platforms Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Media Support Resources See also: CTL Portfolio Get Support Send inquiries to ColumbiaCTL@columbia.edu or contact the learning designer assigned to your department. Platforms CourseWorks Columbia\u2019s learning management system, CourseWorks, is at the center of many instructional technology activities. CourseWorks is supplemented and enhanced by other tools that support a range of instructional objectives, such as tools for online collaboration, presentations, lecture capture, audience response, media annotation, and electronic portfolios. EdBlogs EdBlogs make it easy to share course content and create an online community using a blogging format. EdBlogs provides a blog for any course offered at Columbia University upon the course instructor\u2019s request. Ed Discussion Ed Discussion is a Columbia-supported communication, discussion, and Q&A platform that is integrated with CourseWorks (Canvas). Ed Discussion combines Question, Post, and instructor Announcement threads into a single interface, and offers tools to help instructors and students keep class discussions and communication organized and easy to access, even for large courses! Gradescope Gradescope is a tool designed to streamline and standardize the grading of paper-based, digital, and coding assignments. Gradescope allows for handwritten assignments to be graded digitally, and for multiple graders to collaboratively develop and implement their grading rubrics. It supports problem sets and projects as well as worksheets, quizzes, exams, and papers. LionMail LionMail includes LionMail (Google) Drive which provides unlimited file storage, as well as access to Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, and Forms. All these document types offer multiple collaboration and sharing options Locus Tempus Locus Tempus is an open-source mapping platform developed by the CTL. It facilitates map-based learning activities across disciplines by engaging students to act as repository builders, researchers, and curators. Locus Tempus features tools for annotating maps, inviting collaborators, and analyzing data spatially and temporally. The platform integrates with CourseWorks, allowing Columbia instructors to easily set up assignments for their courses. Mediathread Mediathread is an innovative platform built by the CTL that supports close analysis of video, audio files, and images that are gathered from a range of online sources or individual collections. Course-specific Mediathread sites allow instructors to create and track a range of assignments that ask students to link claims to specific evidence in media objects. Mediathread allows students to make selections of these objects, incorporate these selections into essays and discussions, and share insights with the instructor or the rest of the class. Panopto Media Service Panopto is Columbia\u2019s media platform featuring full storage and streaming functionality for audio and video content. Panopto supports recording and live streaming of classes and other events and can be integrated with CourseWorks/Canvas and other services through LTI integration. Panopto is particularly useful for flipped classroom, lecture capture/review, and online programs. Poll Everywhere Audience Response Systems (ARS), including Poll Everywhere, are used in classrooms of all sizes to engage participants by facilitating interactions among the students and the instructor. Instructors use audience response technologies to communicate with learners and collect feedback on questions. Learners respond to these questions using their own web-enabled devices, such as a phone, tablet, or laptop computer. QuizCon QuizCon is a tool that was developed by the Columbia University Center for Teaching and Learning to extend the utility of online multiple choice quizzing. Using Confidence Weighted Multiple Choice questions, which is discussed in more detail here, QuizCon aims to improve the multiple choice quizzing experience for both students and teachers. Zoom Video Conferencing Zoom features full video conferencing functionality, breakout rooms, Canvas integration, and support for Android and iOS mobile. Do-It-Yourself Media Creating Effective Educational Videos Video has become an important component of many flipped, blended, and online classes, but ensuring that videos are helping students involves taking a deeper look at video design and production. The key to designing effective educational videos is to begin with clear instructional intentions and follow research-based design principles. Instructors should consider general principles explained in this resource. Video Production Best Practices This page takes instructors through the process of setting up, recording, editing and publishing video recordings, and provides other technical considerations for creating active and engaging classroom experiences using video. While these best practices are meant for recorded presentations, they are also helpful for conducting Zoom video sessions. Tools for Do-It-Yourself Video With the right content preparation, camera and audio setup, and a little bit of editing, instructors can create their own educational videos. This resource recommends tools that are easy to use and generally free or low cost, some of which are available for instructors to try in the CTL\u2019s Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Recording Booths. Do-It-Yourself Recording Booths The CTL DIY Recording Booths at Butler Library and CUIMC are available for instructors who wish to create recordings for their courses using equipment that is a step up from typical laptop options. The booths are quiet and private spaces outfitted with cameras, lighting, microphones, backdrops, and necessary software. Support Resources See also Resources and Guides .

This Provost\u2019s Senior Faculty Teaching Scholars program brings together an annual cohort of senior faculty who each have the opportunity to create a vision and plan for supporting, changing and innovating the culture of teaching and learning within their own department or school, and across campus. The program\u2019s goal is to complement the CTL\u2019s educational development expertise with perspectives of current Columbia faculty, and to enhance the culture of teaching and learning at Columbia with a specific focus on equitable, inclusive, and anti-racist pedagogy. Specific objectives for the Provost\u2019s Senior Faculty Teaching Scholars program include: To engage a small cohort of senior faculty as partners in select programs that advance evidence-based pedagogy. To deepen the CTL\u2019s understanding of faculty development needs at Columbia, allowing the Center to set informed priorities for this work. To cultivate Senior Faculty Teaching Scholars as ambassadors with insight about Center for Teaching and Learning strengths and what the Center can offer to faculty, departments, and schools. How are faculty nominated for this program? Deans nominate senior faculty who are both outstanding teachers and well-respected researchers in their disciplines.

Similarly, academics have adapted to new ways of conducting research, aided by technological advancements that provide faster and more convenient ways to investigate their questions. In this Learning Community, we will explore the intersection of these ideas, asking how technology not traditionally reserved for the classroom can be used as a way to incorporate active learning into a course. In session 1, we will discuss the dichotomy of EdTech vs. research technology to contextualize our plans for bringing technology into our own classrooms. We will then think about unconventional (i.e. not specifically built for education) technologies that could be used as teaching tools, and participants will begin to build their own technology-focused active learning lesson plans. In session 2, participants will share and workshop their lesson plans, and we will discuss more broadly the benefits and pitfalls of incorporating technology in the classroom. Participants will walk away from this Learning Community with a ready-to-use lesson plan and a better grasp of how technology can and should be used to aid student learning.This LC will meet in person\u00a0and is designed and facilitated by Rachel Cohen and Luke Lea, Senior Lead Teaching Fellows at the Center for Teaching and Learning. Participants should register for and attend both sessions of this LC. Registration for Session 2 on Friday 10/18, 1:10pm\u20132:25pm, is available here .

Instructors are increasingly expected to understand how course climate\u2014the intellectual, social, emotional, and physical environment of a class\u2014impacts their students, and respond to calls for inclusive classroom environments from both students and administrators. 1 But creating a supportive learning environment for all students can be challenging. Where do you begin? The Guide for Inclusive Teaching at Columbia helps instructors answer that question by offering five inclusive teaching principles derived from research and evidence-based practices. In addition, the guide contains practical, accessible, and usable strategies that instructors can use immediately . We invite you to contact the CTL with questions, suggestions, or ideas for collaborating with us on this initiative at columbiaCTL@columbia.edu . Download the Guide The Guide for Inclusive Teaching at Columbia by Columbia University Center for Teaching and Learning is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License . \u201cExcellence in teaching and learning necessitates the inclusion of every student\u2019s unique identities, experiences, and talents. The Center for Teaching and Learning\u2019s Guide for Inclusive Teaching at Columbia is a great resource for our faculty and graduate instructors to better understand different facets of inclusive teaching and make meaningful changes to their classrooms. As President Bollinger reminds us in his Diversity Mission Statement , \u2018building a diverse university community is not the work of a moment. It requires sustained commitment, concerted effort, and the attention of us all.\u2019 I hope that the guide and related CTL programming will provide you with the resources you need to improve learning for all .\u201d Soulaymane Kachani, Ph.D. Senior Vice Provost , Columbia University Inclusive Teaching Principles Introduction Learn more about the approach to the guide and the creation of the five principles. Principle 2 Set explicit student expectations. Principle 4 Design all course elements for accessibility. Principle 1 Establish and support a class climate that fosters belonging for all students. Principle 3 Select course content that recognizes diversity and acknowledges barriers to inclusion. Principle 5 Reflect on one\u2019s beliefs about teaching to maximize self-awareness and commitment to inclusion. Footnotes The CTL researches and experiments. The Columbia Center for Teaching and Learning provides an array of resources and tools for instructional activities. Overview Ambrose, Susan A., Michael W. Bridges, Michele DiPietro, Marsha C.

When entering the classroom, instructors and students alike bring with them all of their experiences and challenges. In this way, learning spaces act as microcosms of the larger \u201coutside\u201d world. In times of stress, it can be challenging to navigate these spaces, as an emotionally distressing event beyond the classroom can manifest itself in a classroom in ways that impede mental, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning of students (Cavanaugh, 2016; Cook et al., 2005; Darragh & Petrie, 2019; Eyler, 2018; Sitler, 2009). This resource offers strategies for teaching during times of stress and highlights campus support available to help you and your students navigate challenges. Interwoven are excerpts from thank you notes submitted by Columbia students to their professors (through the CTL\u2019s Thank-a-Professor | Thank-a-TA initiative), a good reminder of the gratitude students have for the things we do in the classroom to support them.

Teaching in Times of Stress and Challenge. Columbia University. Retrieved [today\u2019s date] from https://ctl.columbia.edu/resources-and-technology/resources/teaching-in-times-of-stress/ Introduction: Adopting Pedagogies of Care Perhaps one of the most significant things we can do as teachers is to care for our students as learners. Caring pedagogies do not require us to lower standards or to cross boundaries. They simply require that we be present for our students as fellow human beings and that we invest ourselves in helping them to succeed. (Eyler, 2018: 148) Columbia faculty and TAs are on the frontlines of teaching and learning, often doing the emotional labor needed to help students continue learning during challenging times. Over the past several years, we learned much about how to navigate teaching and learning in a time of great stress and challenge and it\u2019s important that we not leave these lessons behind. It is essential to take these lessons forward, and adopt pedagogies and approaches that allow for proactive responses. Hitting pause to reflect back on the experience of teaching through such a stressful and challenging time, one recognizes that pedagogies of care (e.g., empathy for our students and ourselves; flexibility with regards to our course designs) are essential and can remain pillars in our teaching approaches. Instructors can build a pedagogy of care with social and emotional presence by showing that they are human and recognizing that their students are people outside of the classroom (Eyler and Cavanaugh, 2020). Some instructors feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and feelings about recent events and their own challenges with their students. A little bit of vulnerability can help students feel connected and comfortable asking for help (Mays, 2021). Additionally, sharing campus resources that are available to help students through challenging times, lets students know that we see them as whole beings. \u201cI wanted to say thank you for all you have done this year. I have never felt as supported by a professor at Columbia as I have in this course. I appreciate your critical insight for all the texts we have read but also for your understanding, care, and flexibility as an instructor. I cannot tell you how many times your extensions have given me a breath of relief from stress . (\u2026)\u201d \u2013 Student writing to Annie Pfeifer , Assistant Professor of Germanic Languages. Course: Contemporary Civilization in Spring 2021. \u201cThank you so much for your unwavering energy. Throughout a year of high stress and unexpected changes, you were a welcome constant. I knew that every time I showed up to lab I would be able to learn from someone who cared about my education and my future. Thank you for making me laugh, taking your time to explain even the easiest concepts, and always encouraging our growth.\u00a0 You saved us all this year.\u201d \u2013\u00a0 Student writing to Mary Moran , Instructor in Nursing at CUIMC. Course: SIM Lab in Spring 2021. The following sections highlight some of the elements and approaches to enacting a pedagogy of care. Read on and visit University Life\u2019s page on supporting students during times of stress for faculty and staff for FAQs and additional resources, and see additional campus resources in times of crisis . Take Care of Yourself Pedagogies of care emphasize instructors\u2019 social and emotional presence in the classroom, helping students see that they are recognized as whole beings. However, before instructors can show up in this way for their students, it is important that they show up for themselves. Thus, this resource starts with taking care of yourself, which is a process that can look very different for many people. The workload both in and out of the classroom can be overwhelming; teaching in times of collective trauma can make that work feel more challenging and more exhausting. Recognize that you are best able to support your students when you practice self-care. Proactively create a self-care plan and identify campus resources and networks to help you navigate challenges, while maintaining your personal and professional responsibilities. Columbia resources to explore include: Columbia Resources for Faculty, Staff, and Researchers , Office of University Life Resources for faculty as well as where faculty can refer students to for support. Columbia University has trained counselors for students through Columbia Health. Employee Assistance Program (EAP), Human Resources Featured resources include TalkSpace, Life Coach, as well as other Emotional Well-being resources. Well-Being Services , Human Resources Provides a portal to mental health, sleep resources, EAP,virtual visits, wellness coaching and resources, ergonomic program, health advocate, physical fitness, preventive care women\u2019s health, work/life programs, emergency travel assistance, and a calendar of events. Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Advancement , Office of the Provost Resources include The Faculty Lounge (faculty-only Slack workspace) and the Well-Being resources from the Office of Work/Life. Center for Teaching and Learning , Office of the Provost Teaching is hard; you don\u2019t have to go it alone! We offer individual consultations and live events that foster community among instructors. Acknowledge what is going on \u201cToo often it can be easy to slip into the trap of seeing our classrooms as separate from the world, an intellectual oasis from the life beyond its walls. Nothing could be further from the truth. Students do not drop their worries, stressors, and needs at the door when they come to learn from us. Having a sense, then, of the psychological and social dimensions that affect learning can be a powerful tool for teachers.\u201d (Eyler, 2018: 187) Whether events are taking place on campus, within the local community, nationally, or internationally, students appreciate instructors that acknowledge what is going on in the world beyond the classroom, that these events may elicit a variety of emotions, and that students may be experiencing challenges. Recognize that students may have a hard time concentrating on learning, completing activities, meeting assignment deadlines, or remaining motivated to engage in class or study outside of class. For support with navigating these potentially difficult conversations with students, see the CTL\u2019s resource Navigating Heated, Offensive, and Tense Moments in the Classroom . Ensure your course designs and policies do not add stress Transparency about your course goals, assessments, and policies help manage student expectations. It is possible to build-in both rigor and flexibility into courses. Consider how course designs or course policies might need to be adjusted so that they do not add undue stress to you and your students. Re-examine your course and your expectations for the semester: What are the learning objectives for your course? Do those learning objectives need to be readjusted and narrowed down to the most essential that you would like your students to focus on? Can some of the assignments be replaced with more flexible options? For example, could you administer more frequent lower-stakes quizzes rather than one or two high-stakes exams? Could you allow students to produce their final projects in a multimedia form (video, podcast, oral presentation, etc.) rather than just an extensive final paper? Just as it is important to ensure that course design and policies don\u2019t add undue stress, it is equally important for instructors to set clear boundaries for expectations. Be explicit about what students should expect from you around communication, email response times, assignment feedback, etc.: be sure that students know your preferred methods of contact. Being explicit benefits both students and instructors; students will appreciate knowing how they should communicate and when they can expect responses and feedback, while for instructors, \u201can intentional approach to boundaries can help us balance care for students, a commitment to the standards of our disciplines, and self-care.\u201d (Schwartz, 2020). Foster a class environment of trust, connection, and communication Student learning benefits from a classroom environment that prioritizes rapport, trust, and connection among students, and between students and the instructor. Thus, it is essential to remember the importance of accessibility in teaching and learning , inclusive teaching , and anti-racist pedagogical practices . Additionally, trauma-informed teaching practices (see Baez & Marquart, 2020; Carello, 2020a and 2020b) can help inform decisions about our learning environments to ensure students feel respected, supported, and empowered. Students appreciate knowing that they can communicate with you if they have a concern about their learning in the course or their ability to complete tasks. Let students know how best to communicate with you and connect with you during or outside of class time and office hours. If a student does not come to you and you are concerned about the student\u2019s well-being, you can reach out to your dean or counselor for advice. You may also consider holding space and time to respond to the current moment, providing students opportunities to discuss issues with their peers as they relate to the course and student lives (e.g., talking about race in the classroom \u2013 see Sue 2015 for strategies for facilitating such dialogues). Creating space for dialogue in class, no matter how brief, can help students process and feel a little less alone. Hit pause for reflection and wellness practices Create opportunities for students to refocus and reflect upon and/or process the moment, or to stop and think about themselves as learners. This can be done by embedding contemplative pedagogical practices (e.g., a mindful pause for silence and focused breathing) or through individual reflective writing and/or dialogue. See the CTL\u2019s resources on Contemplative Pedagogy and Metacognition to learn more and to adapt practices that work for your course context and teaching style. Embedding wellness practices into a course can help students (see the ACUE and Active Minds 2020 report for recommended practices). In her presentation for the 2021 Celebration of Teaching and Learning Symposium , Professor Denise Cruz describes how she practiced self care for and with her students. She emphasizes not just the importance of self-care for herself, but also the benefits of modeling such practices for her students. Check-in with students Regular check-ins allow you to gauge how students are doing and to partner with them to remove any course obstacles that may get in the way of their learning. Invite students to reflect on how the class environment or other course elements are supporting them. When events arise, you can ask your students: \u201chow can I help you learn during these difficult times?\u201d (Mays, 2020). Office hours and anonymous surveys (e.g., a mid-semester check-in ) can be helpful to stay informed and make adjustments accordingly. Empower students to seek help Equip students with the skills and resources they need to build resiliency and foster community beyond the classroom. Include campus wellness resources on your syllabi, add links to these resources in your CourseWorks site, mention them in class, and remind students of the Columbia University resources available. A few resources to share: Columbia Health , Columbia Health Resources for students to improve and maintain their mental health, such as Individual Counseling , Friend2Friend (training to support peers), and Coping Tools (which includes Columbia Health\u2019s Guide to Coping with Loss and Grief) Well-Being at Columbia , Office of University Life Overview of campus resources, programs, and practical strategies for well-being for Columbia students. Live Well | Learn Well , Undergraduate Well-Being at Columbia Comprehensive list of resources for students to maintain their well-being at Columbia. These range from Academic Advising to Inclusion and Belonging. \u201cAbsolute gratitude and love for making my first semester of Graduate School totally welcoming and fulfilling. We are living through a global pandemic, a re-energized racial uprising, and a wild presidential election. It\u2019s been a pleasure to start the week with your Monday morning class. You\u2019ve made the energy of a virtual class engaging by keeping us thinking and laughing. You have been the only professor who has addressed the importance of boosting our mental health during this horrible moment. Your weekly check-ins and reminders for us to do something that makes us happy are fundamental tools for self-care. This activity also forges beautiful and important relationships between students and professors. Thank you for celebrating and practicing a pedagogy of joy, critical thinking, and subversion.\u201d \u2013 Camilo Godoy, student, School of the Arts, writing to Christina M.

Below are moves that instructors can make to support student learning while upholding academic integrity. Talk with your students. In addition to transparently communicating your expectations and policies around academic integrity and AI use on your syllabus , engage in ongoing conversations with your students. Help students understand what academic integrity means and why it is important to your course and their learning. Make space for their questions. Revisit course and University policies (on academic integrity and generative AI ) with students before they complete assignments. Engage students in conversations about learning and their process. Remind students of how learning works and that \u201cthe one who does the work does the learning\u201d ( Doyle, 2011 ). Ask students to explain their thinking, their approach to completing assignments, the choices they made, sources used, etc. An assignment or exam wrapper can be used to guide students as they reflect on their process. Questions might include: how did you approach studying for this exam? What strategies did you use? What challenges did you encounter while working on this assignment, and how did you address them? What was your process for completing this assignment? How did you incorporate the feedback that was provided? What sources did you draw upon and why? What might you do differently to improve your work going forward? Take the stress out of assessments. Build in low stakes or no stakes assessments that align with course objectives and provide students with opportunities to practice skills and receive feedback. For high stakes assignments, explain the relevance of the assignment. Invite students to ask questions. Break down the assignment into smaller manageable parts, providing feedback along the way. Encourage students to focus on the learning process. Find additional suggestions in the Designing Assignments for Learning resource. Normalize help seeking. Provide resources to help students thrive in your course. Encourage your students to bring up academic challenges and seek help from you, TAs, peers, tutors , or other campus resources. Check your students\u2019 understanding of assignments expectations, and check in with them on their progress. Invite students to receive support during office hours. Communicate what level of AI use is permitted in your course assessments. Select the desired level of AI usage in your course assessments based on the learning objectives (draw on the Artificial Intelligence Assessment Scale (AIAS) as a starting point). Transparently communicate your expectations of AI use to your students. Explain to students what gen AI can be used for in course work, when, and why. Teach students how to appropriately acknowledge the use of AI. This can include citation practices (e.g., APA and MLA ), submitting a copy of their interaction with an AI tool or a reflection or acknowledgement statement along with their work detailing their process for completing coursework and the ways they used AI. By intentionally building this into the learning process, students are more self-aware and develop their metacognition skills.

Participants learn about setting up assignments within CourseWorks using various tools, and navigate the different grading features available within CourseWorks to grade assignments, quizzes, and discussions. The course itself models the ways in which Canvas can be used for different course activities. Enroll now This Learning Community is sponsored by the GSAS Office of Academic Diversity and Inclusion in partnership with Columbia\u2019s Center for Teaching and Learning. The Learning Community is open to all Columbia University graduate students, with priority given to GSAS students who currently hold teaching appointments at the University. The Learning Community collectively engages focused topics in pedagogy and practice as they relate to race and marginalization, with particular emphasis on anti-racist and anti-oppression pedagogy. Participants explore how various forms of oppression shape teaching and learning at Columbia and develop skills to support anti-racist and anti-oppression pedagogical thinking and practice.

Learn more and register \ud83d\udca1Resource Spotlight Feedback for Learning Feedback and revision are important parts of any learning experience. From in-class activities and assignments\u00a0to peer-reviewed manuscripts, timely feedback is essential for growth and learning. And yet, if students don\u2019t reflect on or apply notes or comments, it can sometimes feel like feedback doesn\u2019t matter all that much. This resource offers strategies to make giving feedback easier and more effective in any kind of course (e.g.: large lecture, seminar) and across any modality (e.g.: synchronous, asynchronous, fully online, hybrid, or in-person). Access Feedback for Learning resource Upcoming Lead Teaching Fellow Events The 2024-25 Lead Teaching Fellows are running workshops and discussions in departments all around Columbia. These are generally advertised locally. Below are upcoming events that are open to participants beyond the LTFs home department. Read more about the LTF program here , connect to an LTF in your department via the LTF directory , and discover more upcoming LTFs events on the LTF calendar . LTF events count towards track completion in the Teaching Development Program . Developing your Teaching Signature: Intentionality, Reflection, and Progress What type of teacher do you want to be? How do you make that dream a reality? In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore concepts and methods for developing your own teaching signature. First we\u2019ll situate ourselves by defining teaching signatures. Then we\u2019ll consider what it means to self-assess, and examine how we can better achieve pedagogical goals. Finally, we\u2019ll work on developing personalized statements that summarize our own pedagogical goals in a class-independent way. By the end of this session you should be able to: 1. Identify teaching characteristics you wish to embody 2. Reflect productively on your current teaching style 3. Develop a two-sentence statement that defines your personal teaching signature This workshop will be focused on instructors in the natural sciences. All material needed for the workshop will be provided there, as well as snacks!\u00a0This workshop is led by Lead Teaching Fellow Bennett Slibeck (Earth and Environmental Sciences) and\u00a0is open to all graduate students.

This workshop is led by Lead Teaching Fellow\u00a0Ines Aitsahalia\u00a0(Neurobiology and Behavior) and\u00a0is open to all graduate students\u00a0(although focused on scientific disciplines). Date: Wednesday, October 2 Time: 6:30pm Location: JLGSC-L7-081 (Jerome L. Greene Science Center,\u00a03227 Broadway) Register: via this form Holistic Teaching and Historical Justice: Recognizing the Flaws and Immorality of Important Researchers in Our Fields Academia is strewn with examples of people who were far from perfect, but contributed significantly to their fields. Recognizing the flaws of these actors is not just a gesture at historical justice, but is necessary to help us understand their outlooks and thus how their ideas were formed. The question is, though: when is it necessary to dig up these skeletons, and how can we do so in a way that enhances student learning and holistic understanding? How we approach this issue not only shapes the historical reputation of many, but our interpretations of our fields\u2019 theories and findings. This workshop is led by Lead Teaching Fellow Ed Barry (Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology) and\u00a0is open to all graduate students.

We will examine how certain discussion topics can unintentionally reveal disparities among students, potentially undermining the sense of community within these classes. Together, we will develop strategies to navigate these challenges, focusing on discussion formats and exercises that encourage meaningful dialogue without necessarily centering on personal experiences.

Soft Skills: Not Hard to Assess How can you tell if your students have learned to think critically, reason ethically, or gain intercultural competence? These and many other so-called \u201csoft skills\u201d are central to learning outcomes across higher education, but are remarkably difficult to assess. In this workshop, we\u2019ll discuss techniques for adapting existing assignments and rethinking everyday classroom activities to become assessment opportunities, allowing you to incorporate these approaches instantly into courses you teach or TA. This workshop is led by Lead Teaching Fellow Gareth Cordery (Music Department) and\u00a0is open to all graduate students. Date: Friday, September 27 Time: 10:00-11:30am Location: 620 Dodge Hall Register: Contact Gareth Cordery at\u00a0gjc2141@columbia.edu Developing your Teaching Signature: Intentionality, Reflection, and Progress What type of teacher do you want to be? How do you make that dream a reality? In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore concepts and methods for developing your own teaching signature. First we\u2019ll situate ourselves by defining teaching signatures. Then we\u2019ll consider what it means to self-assess, and examine how we can better achieve pedagogical goals. Finally, we\u2019ll work on developing personalized statements that summarize our own pedagogical goals in a class-independent way. By the end of this session you should be able to: 1. Identify teaching characteristics you wish to embody 2. Reflect productively on your current teaching style 3. Develop a two-sentence statement that defines your personal teaching signature This workshop will be focused on instructors in the natural sciences. All material needed for the workshop will be provided there, as well as snacks!\u00a0This workshop is led by Lead Teaching Fellow Bennett Slibeck (Earth and Environmental Sciences) and\u00a0is open to all graduate students.

The CTL\u2019s Early and Mid-Semester Student Feedback resource outlines two approaches for collecting feedback from your students: 1) the start-stop-continue method (more information below), and 2) a question bank for gathering feedback from students. The CTL is available to consult with you as you design your feedback survey, interpret the data, and address the results with your students. Start-Stop-Continue The start-stop-continue feedback survey approach gives students a voice in their learning process as it invites them to reflect on their learning experiences and share actionable feedback with their instructor. The method asks students what you can Start, Stop, and Continue doing based on what is and is not supporting their learning: What can we start doing in this class that would help you learn? Is there anything we should stop doing that isn\u2019t helping you learn? If so, please explain. What should we continue doing that is helping you learn? Watch the video and reach out to CTLfaculty@columbia.edu with questions and for assistance as you implement this strategy in your course. Request a teaching observation to receive feedback Request a Teaching Observation! Gain perspective, validate your strengths, and identify areas of your teaching that you would like to work on. The CTL will observe your class and meet with you to share feedback. Our consultants can help you think through your course goals, reflect on your teaching practices that support your students\u2019 learning, and plan manageable next steps to meet your teaching objectives Request an observation Sessions this week Navigating HOT Moments: Before, During, & After Class September 24 , 12:00-1:00pm This session will also be offered on October 15 Related resource: Navigating Heated, Offensive, and Tense (HOT) Moments in the Classroom Science of Learning Research Initiative (SOLER) Journal Club September 24 , 11:00am-12:00pm Faculty Book Discussion Group: Teaching with AI September 26 , 3:00-4:00pm This discussion group will also meet on October 24 and November 21 . Related resource: Teaching and Learning in the Age of AI Healing and Restorative Practices in the Classroom | Dialogue Across Difference September 27 , 9:00-11:00am | 203 Butler Library This workshop, led by Dianne Williams , builds on faculty\u2019s existing skills to support the use of Restorative Justice approaches in the classroom as a way to build community and repair relationships while encouraging reflection, communication, and healing. When students experience a campus climate and relationships that cultivate trust, safety, and belonging, they are more likely to demonstrate positive be\u00adhav\u00adior. Restorative approaches aim to promote student investment and responsibility for shared routines and norms. The CTL is here to help!

Soft Skills: Not Hard to Assess How can you tell if your students have learned to think critically, reason ethically, or gain intercultural competence? These and many other so-called \u201csoft skills\u201d are central to learning outcomes across higher education, but are remarkably difficult to assess. In this workshop, we\u2019ll discuss techniques for adapting existing assignments and rethinking everyday classroom activities to become assessment opportunities, allowing you to incorporate these approaches instantly into courses you teach or TA. This workshop is led by Lead Teaching Fellow Gareth Cordery (Music Department) and\u00a0is open to all graduate students. Date: Friday, September 27 Time: 10:00-11:30am Location: 620 Dodge Hall Register: Contact Gareth Cordery at\u00a0gjc2141@columbia.edu Developing your Teaching Signature: Intentionality, Reflection, and Progress What type of teacher do you want to be? How do you make that dream a reality? In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore concepts and methods for developing your own teaching signature. First we\u2019ll situate ourselves by defining teaching signatures. Then we\u2019ll consider what it means to self-assess, and examine how we can better achieve pedagogical goals. Finally, we\u2019ll work on developing personalized statements that summarize our own pedagogical goals in a class-independent way. By the end of this session you should be able to: 1. Identify teaching characteristics you wish to embody 2. Reflect productively on your current teaching style 3. Develop a two-sentence statement that defines your personal teaching signature This workshop will be focused on instructors in the natural sciences.

Each video focuses on a specific pedagogical need, presenting an active learning strategy to help meet that need and a brief overview about how you can get started with implementation in your classroom. Watch the following TeachingTalks and reach out to CTLfaculty@columbia.edu with questions and for assistance as you implement these strategies in your course. Think-Pair-Share This active learning strategy involves posing a short problem, scenario, or question to your students and giving them the time and opportunity to complete the following steps: Think through the problem, scenario, or question individually. Pair with a partner to discuss. Share their findings or takeaways with the rest of the class. This strategy gives your students time to process and apply their knowledge and skills on their own first. It also gives them the opportunity to consult and collaborate with a peer. This process makes space for students to prepare to engage with the rest of the class. Polling Polling is a strategy to engage and assess all learners in real-time. Polls invite students to respond to questions using a mobile device. Pose questions that check for understanding, encourage application, capture multiple perspectives, promote reflection on learning, or to collect feedback from students. Learn more about using Poll Everywhere in your classroom and explore the on-demand resource Developing Poll Questions to Engage and Assess Student Thinking in Science and Engineering Courses .

Our mission is to encourage instructors, students, and leaders in higher education to reflect on what they believe about teaching and learning. In each episode, guests are invited to share their discoveries of \u201cdead ideas\u201d\u2014 ideas that are not true but that are often widely believed and embedded in the pedagogical choices we make. Read more Past conversations have focused on dead ideas in topics such as grading, teaching with technology, student motivation, assessment, and teaching and learning systems in the academy and how they need to be changed. Conversations have also explored dead ideas exposed by the move to remote teaching due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope these radically honest conversations will inspire lightbulb moments for our listeners as they seek to understand their own teaching and learning. To listen to an audio trailer, click here. The theme originates from the article \u201cThe Tyranny of Dead Ideas in Teaching and Learning\u201d (The Sociological Quarterly, 2011) by Diane L. Pike, Professor of Sociology at Augsburg University. Pike writes, \u201cIdeas are dead because they are no longer correct, if they ever were. They are tyranny because we cling to them despite the evidence\u2026Clinging to dead ideas about teaching and learning limits our practice as professors. The resulting tyranny means we fail to educate our students as effectively as we might\u2026The good news is that learned behaviors, sociologically informed reflection, and the application of the research in the scholarship of teaching and learning can liberate us and improve the experiences of teachers and learners alike.\u201d Where and When to Listen Episodes are released every other Thursday and are approximately 30 minutes in length.

Today we discuss this question with Marielena DeSanctis , President of the Community College of Denver, and Cassandra Volpe Horii , Associate Vice Provost for Education and Director of the Center for Teaching and Learning at Stanford University, who are co-authors of the article titled, \u201c An Instructional-Workforce Framework for Coordinated Change in Undergraduate Education \u201d (2023). Drs. DeSanctis and Volpe Horii discuss their framework\u2014based on principles of justice, equity, and inclusion\u2014which proposes treating all instructors (Visiting, Instructor, Teaching Assistant, Adjunct, Teaching Professor, TT/Tenured, Lecturer) as a unified workforce. Using the levers of governance, professional development, and reward systems, they offer institutions a path to significant improvement in the teaching of undergraduate science courses.

Through this work, she has realized that AI has, in one fell swoop, rendered an entire constellation of dead ideas in teaching and learning officially obsolete. The ideas that she has advocated for throughout her career, and in the book she co-authored, Learning That Matters: A Field Guide to Course Design for Transformative Education (2020) , are becoming increasingly essential, and she believes that change is imminent. In this episode, Dr. Alby discusses why she believes AI will be the catalyst for the extinction of four big dead ideas in teaching and learning and how that will happen.

Compose Your Message Notes from students: To: Natalie Adler \u201cI have gained so much insight, perspective, and confidence from your class . I recommend you to everyone who asks and do so knowing you provide your students a challenging, yet safe and supportive environment to grow as writers and people, and engage in meaningful, constructive dialogue with one another and the texts we read. Adjusting here has been hard in ways but I know I consistently have a class to look forward to that makes me want to show up as my full, authentic self in full confidence. I have learned so much about writing and the type of writer I want to be, and am convinced that the work you are doing extends far beyond the confines of our classroom, and provides a rare and wonderful educational experience.\u201d From: Sydney Durkin University Writing, Fall 2023 To: Stephen Biddle \u201cThank you, Prof. Biddle, for generously sharing your time in office hours and our post-class discussions. Your class has been a landmark in my academic journey, enriched by your scholarship and infectious passion for teaching. I respect your integrity and deep appreciation for the weight of policy-making, which you instill in your students. You don\u2019t just teach; you empower us to stride confidently into the world, equipped to effect meaningful change. Thank you for being not just a professor, but a mentor.\u201d From: Rasmus Edelmann Foundations of International Security Policy, Fall 2023 To: Karla Childers \u201cWhat a wonderfully amazing subject, course and source of so much captivating knowledge, information, discussion and critical thinking. Thank you for sharing your love and passion with your students and inspiring us to push forward with our Bioethics careers and to fulfill our purpose in life.\u201d From: George Tsiolis Ethics in the Pharmaceutical Industry, Fall 2023 To: Katherine Dimitropoulou \u201cI enjoy and learn so much in her classes. She shifted my way of thinking and taught me to read and apply evidence-based literature from a deeper perspective. I appreciate her enthusiasm for the subject and her ability to teach the material so effectively. \u201d From: Luis Filgueira Neuroscience of Cognition, Fall 2023 To: Gillian Gualtieri \u201cThank you for always being funny, honest, sharp, engaging, understanding, and thoughtful. Thank you for being adaptable and reflective. Thank you for addressing everyone\u2019s questions, always. Thank you for grounding sociology in our lives. Thank you for treating us with respect and empathy. Thank you for always checking in and meeting us where we are at. Thank you for telling us not to apologize for our questions. Thank you for believing in us and always pushing us to do better. You are a wonderful professor. Your hard work does not go unseen! You have engaged so many people with your teaching style, and you have made more people than you know fall in love with sociology! Everyone I know who has taken your classes adores you!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Course: Sociology of Art, Spring 2024 To: Lauren Heckelman \u201cThank you Dr. Heckelman! Walking into your class the first day, I already knew I was going to enjoy your lab. After so many general core classes with 200+ people, walking in and having a professor already have made an effort to know everybody\u2019s names meant a ton. It is so fun to actually be able to connect with a professor again 1 on 1, and you truly make BME lab a great environment for learning. I already have learned so much, and everything translates so well to other jobs and classes. (\u2026) Thank you again for caring so much about your curriculum and students! From: Maggie Nedbalek Biomedical Engineering Lab I, Fall 2023 To: Hardeep Johar \u201cI wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for the learning experience you provided in Data Analytics. Each section of the course was crafted with meaningful insights and practical applications, which I found incredibly valuable. I am amazed at how often I referred back to the examples and lessons learned in your class in my daily life. I felt that the course was very hands-on since the lecture was closely related to the practical homework assignments and in-class examples. Moreover, your sharing of personal anecdotes about your career was not only inspiring but also instrumental in guiding me toward applying for internships. This experience has encouraged me to engage more with my professors in all my classes later on, leading to insightful conversations.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Data Analytics and Machine Learning for OR, Fall 2023 To: Ife Lenard \u201cProfessor Lenard is the best professor I\u2019ve ever had. I\u2019ve never seen someone care so deeply for their students and take on such an emotional burden for the betterment of the field of social work and for her students. This course has been challenging, and Professor Lenard has encouraged us to grow emotionally and intellectually. I know I will look back on this class and the things I have learned for the rest of my career in social work.\u201d From: Kendra Hall Foundations of Social Work Practice, Fall 2023 To: Erich Morisse \u201cI had always believed, or at least experienced, that Teaching Assistants primarily assist the professor with grading or answer students\u2019 questions when the professor is unavailable. However, Erich changed my perspective on this. His guidance was as prominent and steadfast as that of the main professor. His enthusiasm for the different modules and his real-life experiences consistently brought a positive atmosphere to the classroom, which, in turn, enhanced the overall learning experience. Thank you for a great semester and for contributing to a remarkable experience alongside Professor Balkin.\u201d From: Sam Kadouh Strategy and Analytics, Spring 2024 To: Alessandra Saggin \u201c(\u2026) I am particularly grateful for the way you actively seek and value our opinions, backgrounds, and experiences. Your genuine interest in understanding each student\u2019s perspective has not only encouraged open dialogue but has also created a sense of community within the classroom. This inclusive approach has made the learning environment more dynamic and has allowed me to gain insights from a variety of diverse viewpoints.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Intermediate Italian II, Fall 2023 To: Rohan Shah \u201cI want to thank you for your continuous engagement with and support for our Contemporary Civilizations class this year. It\u2019s not always easy to keep students excited to come to class, especially students going on their fourth semester of a year-long Core class, but I can say with confidence that I was eager to come to class and interact with my peers thanks to your guidance and affability. Our classroom felt like a comfortable, safe space in which we could all share our thoughts and perspectives, and your leadership made the class interesting and applicable to my own path of study outside of the Core Curriculum. I will miss your class, but thank you so much for all that you have done to make my personal experience with contemporary civilizations and the Core Curriculum in general a positive and stimulating one. Hope to stay in touch!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Contemporary Civilizations, Spring 2024 To:  Joseph Ulichny \u201cI do not have enough words to describe how amazing Joseph is. He is a Columbia gem, an absolutely insanely patient person, available at all times (I have emailed him at 11pm on a Saturday, and received a response almost immediately, which he absolutely did not need to do). He is always open to questions, and even if you feel like you are asking the dumbest questions possible, he makes sure you know your concerns are valid, and answers them that way. If I could take every class with him, I would probably make mountains move to make it happen. He is a national treasure, and needs to be protected at all costs. He truly made something as tedious as chem lab a great experience by connecting scientific concepts with art history, and talking to us about why that was relevant. I don\u2019t generally care for art, but seeing him excitedly talk about why chemistry was relevant in art, made me interested in it!\u201d From: Anonymous Student General Chemistry Lab-Lecture, Spring 2024 To: Siddharth Sundararajan \u201cI just wanted to say thank you for all of your help during principles this semester. I was worried that as an engineer, I would struggle with concepts in economics, but your patience as a TA really helped me get through it. I was also wondering if I should send you a note thanking you for your help, but then using what I learned from you, I realized that the marginal benefit here clearly outweighs the cost. And now here we are.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Principles of Economics, Spring 2024 To: Constantino Vasiladiotis \u201cJust dropping a quick note to say a huge thank you for being such an awesome teaching assistant throughout the operations management and information technology course. Your kindness, knowledge, and willingness to go the extra mile have made a big difference to me : ) I really appreciated how you helped me out with information for Bloomberg before my meeting. That was a lifesaver! And I\u2019ve loved how you bring in your own experiences to enrich our discussions in class. It\u2019s made the topics so much more interesting and relatable. Thanks again for everything you do. Your passion for teaching and your expertise are truly inspiring, and I feel lucky to have had you as my TA. Looking forward to applying what I\u2019ve learned from you in the future! Cheers!\u201d From: Kshitij Gupta Operation Management and Information Technology, Spring 2024 To: Sambit Sahu \u201cThank you for being such an inspiring, kind, and caring mentor. As a computer science student in both your Cloud Computing & Big Data and Computer Systems for Data Science courses, I greatly appreciate the professor\u2019s commitment to teaching cutting-edge techniques that are immediately applicable in the industry. The engaging project assignments played a crucial role in helping me secure my dream job by enabling me to discuss real-world scenarios during interviews. The thoughtful course design seamlessly integrates essential theory with practical skills, making it a truly enriching experience. Thank you so much!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Computer Systems for Data Science, Spring 2024 To: Tom Panayotidi \u201cThank you so much for being invested in every single one of us not only as students but also as people. I appreciate your efforts to connect with us and to value things such as our culture. When you were so understanding about Lunar New Year, I jumped with joy and showed my parents the email because few professors have shown as much care for a cultural holiday as you have. Thank you for the hours spent in office hours. Whether it is going over concepts or helping me pick out a class schedule, I am appreciative of you taking time out of your business schedule to help us grow. I can\u2019t wait to take many more classes with you!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Structural Design and Computer-aided Structural Design, Spring 2024 To: Anne Heinrichs \u201cProf Heinrichs has been a highlight of my MBA experience so far. The fact that she has made Corporate Transactions and Financial Modeling a fun and insightful course is a testament to her technical knowledge and teaching ability. One can understand how it took her years of professional experience, academic learning, and genuine curiosity to arrive at such a product. Her class is both simple and complete, as she walks us through the complexities of building models from scratch. It helps that she is very high-energy and has a sense of humor! I feel like Prof Heinrichs built the class she wishes she had at the beginning of her career. As a student, I can\u2019t think of a better class to take.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Corporate Transaction & Financial Modeling, Spring 2024 To: Jin Xu \u201cThank you for your wonderful lectures on the arts and people of the Silk Road. It has shifted my mental map and broadened my understanding of the unfamiliar regions on the Eurasian Continent. You are also a great mentor during office hours. I feel heard, validated, and encouraged. And the remarkable research you have done demonstrates there is no limit to how far one can dream.\u201d From: Ivy Chen Arts of the Silk Road, Spring 2024 To: Frank Oswald \u201cAs a Exec Cohort student in the M.S. Strategic Communication Program, I can say hand\u2019s down you are the most outstanding professor I have had in this program. Thank you. You lead our classes with compassion and empathy as we wade through sticky ethical issues. You make room for everyone\u2019s thoughts and contributions and skillfully direct our class conversations. Your content feels fresh and made for the moment \u2013 always bringing in current events to help bring what some might think is purely philosophical to life. Your LinkedIn posts are also amazing and insightful. I\u2019m excited to attend each class, knowing that I will not only acquire more knowledge, but will also benefit from your wisdom and your ability to shape our discussions. Thank you for being awesome. Columbia is better because of you; I am, as well. I wish you many more years of sharing your light and knowledge with others.\u201d From: Cynthia Wood Ethical Decision Making for Communicators, Spring 2024 To: Lincoln Mitchell \u201cThank you Lincoln for helping us navigate a difficult semester last Fall, by brilliantly guiding us through readings and discussions while allowing us to express our opinions freely. Your knowledge, acumen, and kindness created a stimulating environment where I felt like I\u2019ve learned more than in any other class. Your empathy and intellectual capacity is what I wish I had found in more professors at Columbia, and I wish there were more classes I could take with you as teacher. You\u2019re always open to listening to opinions different than yours, and you never shut anyone down. Thank you sincerely!\u201d From: Diletta Andreozzi Inside the Situation Room, Conceptual Foundations of International Politics, Fall 2023 To: Donna Hitscherich \u201cYour passion for your work is so admirable and I feel fortunate to be able to experience and imbibe that kind of energy. Everything about the class was so well structured, I learnt a ton. I was able to grow so much because of how uncomfortable and new I was to the whole industry/subject. The speakers and the cases were so well picked, my favorite was the UnderArmour case (cue chest thumps). I hope to be carry with me the learnings and the class discussions. You taught me a completely new way of looking at a company and think on a much larger scale, and I think no gift can match that.\u201d From: Sana Habeeb Mergers And Acquisitions, Spring 2024 To: Lawrence Bartlett \u201cThank you, Professor Bartlett, for giving us insightful lectures on health economics. The course content is practical and exciting. How you lecture with different perspectives and examples inspires intellectual and critical thinking. You are also very respectful and equitable in treating students with different backgrounds. You create a comfortable and safe environment for students to engage, speak up, and take risks. Thank you for the amazing lectures.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Intro to Health Economics, Fall 2023 To: Colleen Maher \u201cThank you Dr. Maher for being supportive and understanding with me this semester. I just wanted to acknowledge that you went above and beyond to support our class. Thank you for being patient and your constant encouragement for us to push forward and succeed.\u201d From: Armando Reyes Human Anatomy, Fall 2023 To: Ana Kelly \u201cThank you for sparking my interest in cardiac pathology, working in the ICU, and for teaching me how I can be a better critical thinker under pressure! \u201d From: Amanda Karis Med Surg 1, Fall 2023 To: Veronica Hylton \u201cThe feedback and insight of my TAs have not only been instrumental in my understanding of the material for this course, but enriched my experience in sum at the institution. Veronica\u2019s thoughtful questions, taken with the quality of the curriculum at Barnard have, not in small part, lent direction to the focus of my undergraduate program at Columbia.\u201d From: Anonymous Sudent Introduction to American History to 1865, Fall 2023 To: Manasi Soman \u201cManasi, I loved your consistent feedback and how fast you reply to Slack messages. You have a great speaking voice/tone and if you ever decide to pursue academia or become a professor, just know I will be at every seminar you give. I am inspired!\u201d From: Lisa Disalvo User Interface Design, Fall 2023 To: Rajiv Sethi \u201cIf I had to choose one word to describe Professor Sethi, it would be dedicated. His dedication to his subject and his students shines through with everything he does. He warmly refers to all of his students\u2019 by name despite the class consisting of 50+ students, always encourages questions and clarifications, and enthusiastically delves deep into the class material.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Intro to Economic Reasoning, Fall 2023 To: Vincent McCloskey \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to try ballet, but have a hearing impairment that can cause me to struggle with my balance, and finding musical timing. When I signed up for this class I expected to just stay under the radar and do my best, however, you immediately made me feel comfortable. Because I felt so supported I was able to push myself in class to try my hardest, and wasn\u2019t afraid to ask for help and corrections . I think that dance will continue to be a part of my exercise practice, and I\u2019m so glad to have unexpectedly found something that I love to do.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Ballet I, Fall 2023 To: Rebecca Grossman \u201c(\u2026) Thank you for being so patient with my questions and helping me so much with my transition into your class. I was so overwhelmed and nervous to the point of questioning my ability at that time, and it was your quick and detailed replies that comforted and encouraged me. Thank you for being this amazing professor.\u201d From: Anonymous Student BC2001-Mechanics, Fall 2023 To: Noel Ramirez \u201cI am so grateful for Professor Ramirez. He is incredibly understanding, patient and kind. He provides a safe space for us to learn difficult materials, and also listens to what us students want to learn the most. He\u2019s willing to change up lesson plans to match what the students\u2019 passions are. On top of it all, he\u2019s also able to incorporate good humor into class to help us feel at ease. I was so anxious about my first semester in grad school, and he was my first class this semester. He set such a wonderful tone and I\u2019m so grateful for him.\u201d From: Rebecca Strauss Levy Foundations of Social Work Practice, Fall 2023 To: Austin Mantele \u201cYour passion for the subject matter and dedication to fostering a positive learning environment made a significant impact on my academic experience. Your insightful lectures, thoughtful feedback, and willingness to go the extra mile to ensure our understanding did not go unnoticed. Your expertise and enthusiasm have not only deepened my understanding of the course material but have also inspired me to explore the subject further. Your commitment to student success is truly commendable, and I feel fortunate to have had you as my professor. Thank you once again for your invaluable contributions to my education. I look forward to carrying the knowledge and skills I\u2019ve gained under your guidance into future endeavors.\u201d From: Anonymous Student University Writing, Fall 2023 To: Gal Katz \u201cThis semester Professor Katz did an amazing job at keeping the lectures engaging. What I appreciate most is his ability to engage all of the students and make us all feel heard. He makes it clear that all of our input is valuable. He is accessible to his students which has fostered a sense of community within our classroom. Personally he has helped me to realize that although my background and upbringing may be different my contribution to the classroom is still welcomed and valuable. He has empowered me to continue to do my best and to work through any self doubt that I carry. I am eternally grateful for the support and encouragement that he has given me this semester which will stay with me as I progress through my time at Columbia.\u201d From: Mayra Martinez Contemporary Western Civilization 1, Fall 2023 To: Astrid Andre \u201c When I am a teacher, I want to be like Professor Andr\u00e9. She had a wonderful way of ensuring broad class participation, making the material accessible, but never compromising on the high standard needed to master the valuable toolkit. I thought the way she handled questions in class, involved and encouraged us all, was remarkable. Although she gave us tough hypothesis assignments and a final exam, I loved how the questions integrated all our learning goals. The grades were a clear reflection of our understanding, stretching us to work even harder. I loved the inclusion of short videos, that were always played without a hiccup (which shows preparation) and also appreciated that slides were updated after a class session and additional material shared. This course was the toughest, but the highlight of my semester!\u201d From: Anonymous Student The Business of Nonprofits, Fall 2023 To: Sean Bryant \u201cYour contribution to this course is immense. Your dedication to our learning is obvious in the time and effort you put into our recitation problem sets, answer keys, office hours, exam review sessions, and in general going the extra mile to help whenever you can. You\u2019re not only incredibly patient but also a gifted teacher and quiet leader (the best kind) who is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about organic chemistry. Without your additional insight and teaching, I would certainly not learn as much in this course. You\u2019ve made it not only more approachable but truly *fun* to solve puzzles and learn patterns (I can\u2019t believe I used \u201cfun,\u201d but I think it\u2019s true). Thank you so very much. You\u2019ve been by far my best TA at Columbia. I think I speak for the whole class when I say, you are very appreciated!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Organic Chemistry I, Fall 2023 To: Merlin Chowkwanyun \u201cI wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for your outstanding guidance throughout the Foundation of Public Health class. Your passion for the subject matter, combined with your expertise and engaging teaching style, made the learning experience both enriching and enjoyable. The depth of knowledge you shared and the real-world examples you brought into the classroom significantly enhanced my understanding of public health principles and their practical applications. I appreciate the effort you put into creating a supportive learning environment, encouraging thoughtful discussions, and fostering a sense of curiosity among your students. Your commitment to our academic growth has not gone unnoticed, and I am truly grateful for the impact you\u2019ve had on my education. Thank you once again for your dedication to teaching and for being a source of inspiration in the field of public health. I look forward to applying the valuable insights gained from your class in my future studies and career.\u201d From: Ram Bhandari Foundation of Public Health, Fall 2023 To: Daniel Geller \u201cI want to thank you for challenging me professionally and personally throughout the semester. You are caring and always there for us. I truly appreciate your teaching considering multiple learning styles. I also enjoyed focusing heavily on decision-making and performance patterns allowing me to strength my clinical skills to a new level. Thank you very much for the course. I enjoyed every minute of your lecture as well as your sense of humor.\u201d From: Luis Filgueira Cognitive Basis of Function and Decision Making, Spring 2024 To: Sunil Gulati \u201c(\u2026) Having a professor that goes the extra mile to make the teacher-student relationship more personable makes the class more enjoyable and motivating. For many of us, it is also a chance to practice and experience networking with those we want to learn from, for the first time. Overall, I appreciate that Professor Gulati has shown he cares about his students even in a large classroom setting, as well as teaching with passion and energy.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Principles of Economics, Fall 2023 To: Nihal T. Isiksel \u201cI am writing to express my deepest gratitude for the exceptional experience I had in your class. It is rare to find an academic environment where truly inclusive and stimulating dialogue is not just a goal, but a reality, and your class was one of those rare treasures. The small group setting you fostered allowed for a level of engagement and interaction that was both unique and deeply impactful. We actually all became good friends, which, I believe, is the true prerequisite of a good intellectual dialogue. Your skill in managing discussions was nothing short of remarkable. You struck a perfect balance, guiding us without being overly directive, and yet never absent from the conversation. Your subtle artistry in this regard is something I greatly admire. I hope, one day, to be able to conduct discussions in the same fashion. In your class, I felt welcomed and valued, which inspired me each week to actively participate and immerse myself in the learning process. Your human and pedagogical qualities have not only contributed to my educational journey but have also left a lasting impression on me. Thank you for creating an environment where learning is a joy and where each student can feel seen and heard. Your dedication to teaching and your students is truly inspiring. In 10 years of higher education, I rarely experienced that, I am truly grateful.\u201d From: Evan Gregoire Persons, States and Corporations, Spring 2022 To: Yaren Kaya \u201c(\u2026) As an international student, this is my first semester studying at Columbia. At times, I felt overwhelmed by the coursework, but Professor Kaya was friendly, courageous, and supportive. Not only did she emphasize that the focus should be on what we learned and gained from the class rather than just the grades on exams, but she also demonstrated great patience during her office hours to help students understand any concepts they found challenging. The professor\u2019s words and actions have truly boosted my confidence in my learning journey, and I am sincerely thankful to be studying with her in this class!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Optimization Models and Methods, Fall 2023 To: Tuongvi Luong \u201cThank you for being the most amazing TA ever year. Coming into CSSW, and especially into Micro and Macro Economics, I was worried that I wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up. Your labs helped me understand the material so much better and created a space where I felt comfortable and safe to participate and share my thoughts, even if I was not confident that I had the right answer. The energy that you bring to lab is so appreciated, and we can tell that you put so much effort into making sure that we are good and feel alright with the material that we are learning. You have also been such an awesome advocate for us to both professors during the year and I\u2019m sure helped us in ways that we don\u2019t even know about. Thank you so much!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Macroeconomics, Fall 2023; and Policy Analysis II Lab, Spring 2024 To: James Pesci \u201cJames provides an instrumental component to the learning process \u2013 not only reviewing the relevant course material, but shoring up financial concepts for those struggling and providing additional material for those of more advanced backgrounds looking to challenge themselves .\u201d From: Michael Allen Finance II, Fall 2023 To: Nicholas Santiago \u201cThank you so much for making this course engaging and comfortable for me. I really enjoyed your classes and I appreciate the effort that went to keeping the information interesting. All the websites and sources shared are still fun to learn from and I shared it with my friends, who enjoyed them too! I\u2019m especially grateful for the ask-a-neuroscientist panel which broadened my mind towards all the careers possible and I\u2019m also much more comfortable with the idea of exploring my interest as I go. Please thank the people on the panel for their advice and guidance, it was comforting to hear their experience. Lastly, I loved doing the assignments since they were engaging and I enjoyed exploring my interests through selecting topics for my presentations \u2013 so I appreciate the creativity in the assignments given. I\u2019m looking forward to learning more about the field of neuroscience.\u201d From: Prajna Arun Introduction to Neuroscience, Spring 2024 To: Chikako Takahashi \u201cThank you for making learning Japanese one of the most rewarding experiences of my life; it\u2019s crazy to think that I haven\u2019t even been doing it for an entire year. The amount of work and care that you pour into this class does not go unnoticed. From the lecture slides, to the detailed feedback on every assignment we turn in, to the effort you put in organizing chat club, and the little treats you bring us (either \u304a\u304b\u3057 or culture-related bits of knowledge), I appreciate every second I spend in your class. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve enjoyed coming to a class as much as this one in my entire life to the point where some days my biggest motivation for simply getting out of bed is knowing that I have Japanese later in the day.\u201d From: Anonymous Student First Year Japanese 2 To: Claire Greene \u201cIn a world where learning can tighten one\u2019s spleen, Comes a hero, none other than Dr. Greene. Not just a sage on the educational scene, But a beacon of kindness, compassion, and sheen With knowledge vast, you share and guide, Your friendly smile always by our side, Approachable, with arms open wide, In your calm classroom, worries slide.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Psychosocial and Mental Health Challenges in Forced Migration, Spring 2024 To: Larisa Solomon \u201cI know many people have said this already but truly thank you for being so receptive to student thoughts/ideas. You curate such a genuine, curious, and open space for learning and I feel so comfortable asking questions/talking to my peers in the class during discussions. You clearly put your students first. The class itself was fascinating too\u2014I can connect the concepts we learn to everything else I learn/experience as the material is so applicable across disciplines. Thank you for always warming my heart with your \u201cI\u2019m so happy to see you all here today\u2019s\u201d !!!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Moral Psychology, Spring 2024 To: Oliver Simons \u201cProfessor Simons, how grateful I am to have had you as my CC professor. I had no idea what to expect going into CC, but I have left with it being one of my favorite classes of the year. You have helped me learn so many philosophical concepts and analyze so many incredible and difficult to interpret texts, and I will never forget what I have learned. Your class (CC) wins for my longest google document comprising of 119 pages of notes, quotes, and descriptions. Your kindness and intelligence radiate from your teaching, and I hope that you know truly how wonderful you are. I wanted to let you know how much your class and teaching has impacted my Sophomore year at Columbia, I always looked forward to coming to class, even if I truly did not understand what I read the night prior haha. Thank you for such a rewarding semester, and I wish you the best on your adventures to come, you are a gift to Columbia Professor Simons.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Contemporary Civilizations, Fall 2023 and Spring 2024 To: Oliver Simons \u201cProfessor Simons, how grateful I am to have had you as my CC professor.

You always make it a point to answer our questions, however obvious or repetitive. I also appreciate your taking the time to congratulate me on my performance in the mid-term . Given the size of the course, I was taken aback that you would take the time to do so. It has further encouraged me to do my best. \u201d From: Anonymous Student Introduction to Computing for Engineers and Applied Scientists, Spring 2024 To: Yi Zhang \u201cI want to say big thanks to Yi. He always prepares the lecture with interesting and useful contents. He is always happy to answer my questions during the class time. He also cares about his students by providing accommodations so that the course is not stressful. I used to fear the programming class because I generally fell behind the class and felt miserable not understanding the material and homework. But in his class, with his wonderful lecture and very helpful office hour time, (sometimes there are extra office hours), I am able to keep up the course content and feel more confident in my coding ability. He additionally provides me some guidance in academic career which is very helpful for me. I hope I can take another course taught by him in the future semester.\u201d From: Ze Wang Data Engineering with Python, Spring 2024 To: Medini Singh \u201cYour passion for your work is so admirable and I feel fortunate to be able to experience and imbibe that kind of energy. I see myself as an entrepreneur in healthcare, in the future and I feel like I am in a much better position to do so now that I have had a chance to learn from you.

You changed the way I think, it is like I have a new eye for business now, and I think no gift can match that.\u201d From: Sana Habeeb Operations Strategy, Spring 2024 To: Zuar Nurtaza \u201cI want to express my heartfelt thanks for the guidance and support you\u2019ve provided throughout this semester. Your patience and kindness have made learning an enjoyable experience. You stayed after every class to answer our questions on assignments and job applications was extremely helpful and appreciated. Your ability to listen patiently and respond with such kindness has truly made a difference in my educational and career journey. Thank you for being such a remarkable instructor and for all the effort you put into helping me grow.\u201d From: Ocean Yu Financial Risk Management, Spring 2024 To: Katherine Marshall-Polite \u201cAs a military veteran, who served over 30 years in the United States Army, with four combat tours, I was hesitant about going back to school at this juncture in my life. I am eternally gratefully to Professor Katherine Marshall-Polite. She not only did a phenomenal job creating an inclusive, motivational, and inspiring learning environment, she also assisted me with my transition and reintegration back into civilian academic life through her cultural competence and understanding of Military Veteran challenges. She was engaging, approachable and empathetic, which allowed all her students to show up as our authentic selves, and grow each week during the semester. I will never forget my experience as her student. I\u2019m proud to be a Columbia School of Social Work student at 60 years old and excited about beginning a second career; much of that has to do with my time learning from Katherine Marshall- Polite; Thank you so much Professor.\u201d From: Sa\u2019eed Mustafa Human Behavior In The Social Environment, Fall 2023 To: Moneek Madra \u201cDr. Madra is a bank of knowledge, and sets the bar so high for engaging with the class.

I also appreciate how you have truly built a rapport with your TA\u2019s, because they are so equipped to answer questions, and I can tell there\u2019s a good feedback loop. You are an excellent lecturer! It\u2019s second nature to you, and it\u2019s really great to witness. I\u2019m beyond excited for INP next semester \u2013 thank you for being a great educator.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Physiology & Nutrition Through The Lifecycle, Fall 2023 To: Abdul Ahmed \u201cThank you for teaching us to center human rights in our future careers in public health. It has been an honor to learn from you, someone who has been a lifelong champion of human rights. You and your class are why I came to the Mailman School of Public Health , and this university is extremely lucky to have you as a faculty member. I am a better student and critical thinker because of your class, health, and human rights . And I will be a better public health practitioner because of what I learned from you and your class. I have spoken to countless classmates throughout Mailman, and everyone I have spoken to who has taken your class has mentioned how fondly they think of your class and your teaching.

The time and effort you invest in understanding and advising us are truly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time out of your busy schedule to provide guidance! I am especially thankful for your mentorship. I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn from someone as dedicated and supportive as you. I look forward to continuing to grow and learn!\u201d From: Anonymous Student Pricing Models for Financial Engineering, Fall 2023 To: Emma Hitchcock \u201cI know I don\u2019t talk a lot in class, but I just wanted to let you know how much I enjoy your course and how you teach and discuss these books. I always look forward to your class; I find it interesting, reflective, and enjoyable. You are a wonderful professor and I am so grateful to have you for one of my first classes at Columbia.\u201d From: Anonymous Student Literature Humanities, Fall 2023 To: Thomas Groll \u201cThank you so much for being such an empathetic educator professor .

I feel really lucky to learn from her and alongside her. As a Black woman, representation can be hard to find in this field. I am often the only Black woman in my classes and my professors usually do not look like me. Learning from another Black woman is an experience I will forever treasure. Dr. AT inspired me to keep pushing and to stand, unapologetically, in my truth. Thank you so much for a wonderful semester!!\u201d From: Anjanae Lawrence SWP Alcohol and Substance Use, Fall 2023 To: Catherine Suffern \u201c(\u2026) Writing can be an arduous practice, especially after a hiatus from school, but the inclusive and positive learning environment that you foster and promote makes it enjoyable . You clearly take your role seriously, Kate, and respect us all as we are and where we are in our development as writers. I like, and admittedly am amused, when you call us \u2018scholars\u2019.

Dr. Zhang worked closely with the CTL to implement a new in-class auto-grading system to help monitor student progress, offer more immediate feedback, and improve student engagement in his large lecture class. In this spotlight, Yi discusses why he chose to implement this active learning technique, how he worked with the CTL, how it enhanced the student learning experience, how he measured success, and what advice he has for faculty interested in implementing active learning methods into their classrooms. Please describe your course and the learning goals and objectives for students in it. Simulation is a core course for graduate students receiving their MS in Operations Research and MS in Industrial Engineering in the Industrial Engineering and Operation Research Department. In this course, we introduce different simulation techniques with a focus on the application in the field of operation research and business analytics. Students explore simulation techniques both from the theoretical perspective and the application perspective. Besides aiming for a good grasp of simulation theories, students also need to develop the ability to solve real-life simulation problems using the programming skills that they learn. At the end of this course, students are expected to have proficiency in using Python to generate random samples from different statistical distributions based on various sampling methods implement system simulation in various real-world settings, including hospital, inventory, insurance, restaurant, etc, and provide business recommendations improve the efficiency of the system simulation based on important variance reduction methods What were the main challenges/limitations of the previous iteration of your course? Approximately 150 students enroll in this course each semester. Creating an active learning experience for a large class like this has been a challenge. During each lecture, students are given time to work on application-oriented coding questions on their laptops to help them better understand the important theories and methods of the class. Due to the large class size, it is difficult for me to monitor the progress of each student and to offer them immediate help. From the student perspective, they were not receiving valuable feedback while they were implementing their problem-solving process and had long waiting periods before receiving help. For me, as the instructor, I needed to find a way to track the progress of the class to understand their knowledge gaps and offer my help accordingly. What is the intervention that you implemented and how does it enhance the student learning experience? Auto-grading has been adopted in many courses for grading the assignments and exams. For this project, we developed an immediate feedback system by incorporating the auto-grading features into the lectures and making students the primary users of these features. For the in-class exercises, I worked with my teaching assistant, Achraf Bahamou, to program a Python script based on the rubrics we developed for each question. When working on the exercises, a student can submit their work electronically. The script will then run their response through various checkpoints to give them graded marks and provide individualized feedback based on the type of mistakes they made at those checkpoints. Students can then try to learn from the feedback and then correct their mistakes and submit their answers again. On the instructor side, I am able to observe the progress of the students, which is important for me to know where the students stand and adapt my teaching to student needs during the lesson.. Students were very excited about the auto-grading features and were able to use these features effectively to improve their work. In addition, since I have access to all the marked work, I can go over some of the student submissions with the names hidden during whole class discussions. Students were noticeably more engaged when seeing the work from their peers and actively engaging in the learning process from me explaining and correcting common mistakes. What resources did you need to help you implement your intervention? (e.g. CTL support, software, hardware, etc.) This project was an exhibition of great teamwork. Michael Tarnow, Learning Designer of Science and Engineering at CTL, was very involved in the whole pipeline of the project. This project greatly benefitted from his expertise in educational technology and his valuable insights into pedagogical practices. During the proposal stage, I received valuable feedback from Jessica Rowe, the Associate Director for Instructional Technology at the CTL. During the assessment stage, I worked closely with Melissa Wright, the Associate Director of Assessment and Evaluation at CTL and Megan Goldring, a Ph.D. student from the Department of Psychology and a CTL Teaching Assessment Fellow . Achraf Bahamou, a Ph.D. student from the IEOR Department, played an important role in implementing the auto-grading features. He also worked closely with me determining the rubrics of the practice questions and analyzing the assessment results. On the software part, we first experimented with and then used EdStem, a digital learning platform. It included an auto-grading feature that was specifically designed to work in conjunction with Jupyter Notebooks. EdStem also allowed us to seamlessly integrate all the course content and the discussion board on one platform. The platform was unique in that almost all its tools, like the discussion board, were built to run code right in the feature itself. The platform co-founder, Scott Maxwell, was very open to experimenting with different features with us and offered great technical support, often making updates to the platform almost immediately to suit our needs. Did you encounter any design or teaching challenges throughout the implementation? First, there was an upfront cost of learning all the platform features and restructuring all the existing materials into Jupyter Notebook format that would also be well presented on the EdStem platform. This was a time-consuming process for the first iteration. However, this restructured course content so that it was much more organized and easier to follow from the learner\u2019s perspective. The second challenge came from the actual implementation of our new tool. Bringing the immediate feedback system into the lectures was a learning experience for all the stakeholders. During our first experiment, we received mixed feedback from the students. Based on the student feedback we collected from the post-lesson survey, we were able to improve the design and the execution of the intervention. As we moved to the later stages of the course, students became more comfortable with the auto-grading features and were able to gain great appreciation for the intervention . How did you measure the success of this intervention? W e adopted an A/B testing approach by randomly assigning the students into two groups: a treatment group and a control group. Students in the treatment group received the invention, while students in the control group did not. To be fair to the students we would flip who was in the treatment and control groups in the following lesson. In total this experiment was conducted in two sets of two lessons (4 total lessons) at different stages of the course. After each experiment, we used subjective and objective measurements to evaluate the success of the intervention. Subjective measurement: After each exercise, students filled in a short survey hosted on Qualtrics. The goal was to collect their opinions about the problems so they could reflect on their experience with the auto-grading features, and the impact of the intervention on their learning (how confident they felt about the subject matter). Collecting the subjective feedback allowed us to see how the students reacted to the intervention and helped us improve our work from the learner perspective. Objective measurement: We compared student scores from the developed questions to see whether there was any significant difference between students in the control group and the treatment group. This testing offers us an objective measurement of the outcome of the intervention. Based on our assessment, students with access to the auto-grading features were more confident in the subject matter . Across two lectures, students were assigned to either normal Python-based feedback (NIF) or the auto-grading feedback tool (IF-AT), so that half of the students were in the NIF condition in the third lecture and half of the students were in the auto-grading condition in the fourth lecture . From our objective measurement, we observed that students with access to the auto-grading features received a grade that was 30-50% higher on average than those who did not . (All differences were statistically significant with p values < 0 . 015 . ) . See graph below. For which type of classes do you see faculty being able to use this intervention? Do you have any advice for them? Faculty members who are using the flipped-class teaching method or hoping to incorporate some programming exercises in a classroom will find this intervention extremely useful. Being able to create active learning experiences for students has been a challenge for teaching and learning in large classes. Having a learning environment where students can get immediate feedback in the classroom can help the students better engage with the content and detect any misunderstandings early on. It also allows the instructors to collect valuable information from this system to help them improve their teaching.

                        "01/07/2021Dead Ideas: Season Two TrailerWelcome back to Dead Ideas in Teaching and Learning. When we began this podcast, our mission was to encourage instructors, students, and leaders in higher education to reflect on what they believe about teaching and learning. Now, almost a year into the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, it remains a difficult, uncertain moment for higher education. But in that uncertainty, we have a profound opportunity to confront the many dead ideas that have been exposed by the move out of our traditional classrooms and to challenge what teaching means and how it happens. This podcast is a space for reflection, transformation, and learning. Learn more at\u00a0ctl.columbia.edu/podcastS2\u20222 min",
                        "10/12/2020Introducing: Dead Ideas in Teaching and LearningWelcome to Dead Ideas in Teaching and Learning, a new podcast hosted by CTL executive director, Catherine Ross.

The guests\u2014especially students\u2014always elicit new thoughts and stimulate new ideas to eclipse those pernicious \u201cdead\u201d ones. This is definitely worth a regular listen if you are a faculty member, administrator, or graduate student who is involved in teaching and learning in a higher education context.MOREInspiring and ThoughtfulAs a regular listener, I find the topics that are covered and the speakers who are invited reflect up-to-the-moment concerns in the state of teaching and learning in higher education.
