AdvancED offers a diverse array of programs and services that: Apply research-based best practices and professional development. Nurture belonging through equity, inclusion, and caring communities of practice. Promote campus-wide collaboration between leaders, teachers, and learners. Design thoughtful curricula and organizational structures. Partner With Us Educational Design and Development Consultations Individual consultations are among the most beneficial services we offer. Each consultation is focused on your needs, allowing targeted approaches to address your teaching context and goals. These one-on-one consultations are designed to be formative, not summative, and therefore our staff or the information we discuss plays no role in any hiring, reappointment, tenure, or other evaluative process. Consultations can center on any teaching-related question that you have, but they often revolve around several core needs: Syllabus and Course Design Course design review is a valuable first step as you plan your courses and can bring an holistic and intentional approach to the development of multiple course components: your teaching philosophy, learning goals, assignments, learning activities, lesson plans, engagement techniques planning, course policies, or writing your syllabus, just to name a few. Instructional Design We can help you develop well-designed courses in Brightspace, Vanderbilt's learning management system, that can lead students to experience greater understanding, accessibility, organization, self-efficacy, and success. Teaching Observation Observations can be a highly valuable way to identify strengths and possible growth areas in your techniques of lecturing, leading discussions, designing lesson plans, engaging students, fostering inclusion and belonging, and countless other skills. This can be a way to become a more reflective and intentional teacher, and generate new ideas for effectively meeting your goals. This involves scheduling both an observation and a one-hour debrief. Technology Consultation Our team can help you think of what, if any, educational technology might help you innovate and better achieve your teaching goals, including Brightspace, Vanderbilt's learning management system, its associated tools, communications and networking technologies, presentation platforms, classroom response systems, audio/video technology, artificial intelligence, and much more. Teaching Portfolio We can help you reflect, assess, and develop a teaching philosophy, a self-evaluation of your teaching, or other components of your teaching portfolio that can be constructive for your teaching career.

Top Hat is Vanderbilt\u2019s classroom response system, available for free to all faculty, staff, and students . Using Top Hat, instructors can pose polling questions and ask all their students to respond using their phones or laptops. Top Hat quickly collects and visualizes student responses, giving instructors a snapshot of student learning they can use to inform class discussion. See below for ideas on using Top Hat in your classroom, along with step-by-step instructions for getting started. It\u2019s easier than you might think. You might also want to view this pre-recorded instructor workshop for new users: Watch Introduction to Top Hat (20 min.) This instructor-led tutorial is designed for professors or teaching assistants who are brand new to Top Hat. It covers the basics of Top Hat, from creating your account through setting up your first course, to more advanced features like adding a teaching assistant. Multiple Choice Questions Q: Your sister calls to say she\u2019s having twins. Which of the following is more likely? (Assume she\u2019s not having identical twins.) A. Twin boys B. Twin girls C. One boy and one girl D. All three of the above are equally likely. Ask students to respond individually to a multiple-choice question (like this one from former CFT director Derek Bruff\u2019s statistics course), then discuss the question in pairs, then respond again. Then ask students to share reasons for their answers, guiding the discussion toward the correct answer (C in this case). Or ask questions that don\u2019t have single correct answers. See https://tinyurl.com/vandytophat01 for an example of a \u201cone best answer\u201d question from Vanderbilt law professor Ed Cheng. Word Answer Questions Q: What three words come to mind when you think of leadership? Q: What are five or six technologies you\u2019ve used or seen used in teaching? Q: What counts as alien? Answer in 140 characters or less. Top Hat\u2019s word-answer format allows for free text responses, with results displayed as text or as word clouds, in which words appearing more frequently among student responses appear larger. These questions work well for surfacing diverse student perspectives and experiences. For more examples of using word clouds in the classroom, see https://tinyurl.com/vandytophat02 . \u201cAlien\u201d word cloud courtesy Mark Sample (Davidson College). Discussion Questions Q: What questions do you have about plagiarism in academic settings? Q: What did you learn from watching the Citizenfour documentary? Q: What is art? For longer student responses, try Top Hat\u2019s discussion tool, which creates question-specific discussion boards. Scroll through student responses to inform class discussion, or ask students to vote up answers from peers that resonate with them as a way to prioritize responses in larger classes. See https://tinyurl.com/vandytophat03 for an example of a discussion question that led to deep learning in an art class.

One important role a graduate student may hold in their time at VU is that of a teaching assistant. While teaching assistant (TA) duties vary across departments, they all demand considerable skill and knowledge. These duties can include grading, consulting with students during office hours, leading discussion or problem sessions, teaching labs or giving lectures. To assist new TAs as they prepare for their duties, AdvancED\u2019s Office of Educational Design and Development (OEDD) will offer Teaching Assistant Orientation (TAO) each August.

AdvancED offers a diverse array of programs and services that: Apply research-based best practices and professional development.

Design thoughtful curricula and organizational structures. Partner With Us Educational Design and Development Consultations Individual consultations are among the most beneficial services we offer. Each consultation is focused on your needs, allowing targeted approaches to address your teaching context and goals. These one-on-one consultations are designed to be formative, not summative, and therefore our staff or the information we discuss plays no role in any hiring, reappointment, tenure, or other evaluative process. Consultations can center on any teaching-related question that you have, but they often revolve around several core needs: Syllabus and Course Design Course design review is a valuable first step as you plan your courses and can bring an holistic and intentional approach to the development of multiple course components: your teaching philosophy, learning goals, assignments, learning activities, lesson plans, engagement techniques planning, course policies, or writing your syllabus, just to name a few. Instructional Design We can help you develop well-designed courses in Brightspace, Vanderbilt's learning management system, that can lead students to experience greater understanding, accessibility, organization, self-efficacy, and success. Teaching Observation Observations can be a highly valuable way to identify strengths and possible growth areas in your techniques of lecturing, leading discussions, designing lesson plans, engaging students, fostering inclusion and belonging, and countless other skills. This can be a way to become a more reflective and intentional teacher, and generate new ideas for effectively meeting your goals. This involves scheduling both an observation and a one-hour debrief. Technology Consultation Our team can help you think of what, if any, educational technology might help you innovate and better achieve your teaching goals, including Brightspace, Vanderbilt's learning management system, its associated tools, communications and networking technologies, presentation platforms, classroom response systems, audio/video technology, artificial intelligence, and much more. Teaching Portfolio We can help you reflect, assess, and develop a teaching philosophy, a self-evaluation of your teaching, or other components of your teaching portfolio that can be constructive for your teaching career.

AdvancED offers a diverse array of programs and services that: Apply research-based best practices and professional development.

Design thoughtful curricula and organizational structures. Partner With Us Educational Design and Development Consultations Individual consultations are among the most beneficial services we offer. Each consultation is focused on your needs, allowing targeted approaches to address your teaching context and goals. These one-on-one consultations are designed to be formative, not summative, and therefore our staff or the information we discuss plays no role in any hiring, reappointment, tenure, or other evaluative process. Consultations can center on any teaching-related question that you have, but they often revolve around several core needs: Syllabus and Course Design Course design review is a valuable first step as you plan your courses and can bring an holistic and intentional approach to the development of multiple course components: your teaching philosophy, learning goals, assignments, learning activities, lesson plans, engagement techniques planning, course policies, or writing your syllabus, just to name a few. Instructional Design We can help you develop well-designed courses in Brightspace, Vanderbilt's learning management system, that can lead students to experience greater understanding, accessibility, organization, self-efficacy, and success. Teaching Observation Observations can be a highly valuable way to identify strengths and possible growth areas in your techniques of lecturing, leading discussions, designing lesson plans, engaging students, fostering inclusion and belonging, and countless other skills. This can be a way to become a more reflective and intentional teacher, and generate new ideas for effectively meeting your goals. This involves scheduling both an observation and a one-hour debrief. Technology Consultation Our team can help you think of what, if any, educational technology might help you innovate and better achieve your teaching goals, including Brightspace, Vanderbilt's learning management system, its associated tools, communications and networking technologies, presentation platforms, classroom response systems, audio/video technology, artificial intelligence, and much more. Teaching Portfolio We can help you reflect, assess, and develop a teaching philosophy, a self-evaluation of your teaching, or other components of your teaching portfolio that can be constructive for your teaching career.
