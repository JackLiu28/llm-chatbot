Academic Programs Resources Our Mentors Contact the Learning Center Upcoming Mentor Sessions Resources News Contact Observation and Feedback A Key Opportunity for Reflective Teaching We believe that good teaching is reflective teaching. A teaching observation can help facilitate this critical process of reflection. The Center for Teaching and Learning\u2019s Educational Development staff conducts observations of teaching via video-recording and in-class observations for instructors looking for a confidential, outside perspective on the teaching and learning in their classroom. How it Works Generally, staff discusses the class with the instructor prior to the observation to gain understanding about how feedback might be tailored and to understand the unique challenges and opportunities related to teaching and learning in that particular instance. Frequent areas of focus for observations include but are not limited to: Classroom Management, Clarity and Organization of Content, Presentation Skills, Use of Technology, Teaching Methods, and Inclusive Teaching. Following the observation, the instructor meets again with our staff to follow up and consider strengths and areas for growth visible during the session. A confidential observation document is written up after these meetings and shared directly with the instructor. If the CTL has recorded the session for the instructor, an MP4 recording of the class session will be made available to the instructor via WUSTLBox after the observation is completed. Note that all observations are conducted only at the behest of the instructor themselves.

History of the Center for Teaching and Learning The Teaching Center: Early Years The Center for Teaching and Learning, then the Teaching Center, was established at Washington University in St. Louis in 1990 under director Robert McDowell, a professor of Mathematics. The Center\u2019s initial focus on supporting in-class faculty instruction expanded through the late 1990s under the leadership of Jim Davis, professor of History, with a growing emphasis on classroom technology. In 2000, the Center initiated the Teaching Citation program for graduate students and postdocs, beginning a long commitment to supporting the development of future faculty teachers. The Center Grows: 2002-2017 During 2002-2017, led by director Regina Frey (professor of Chemistry), the Center embarked upon an expanded mission that include collaboration with faculty on pedagogical innovation and teaching as a community endeavor through consultations, workshops, and scholarship of teaching and learning that became organized as the division of Academic Services. During this time the Center also took on a more comprehensive role in classroom design, renovation, and support, with the development of design standards informed by pedagogical objectives in collaboration with facilities management. These efforts\u00a0 became the division of Classroom Services. During this period, Academic Services became heavily involved in a variety of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) teaching initiatives that included a workshop series for faculty, a STEM pedagogies workshop series for graduate students, and the promotion of classroom response devices (iClickers) for large courses. The Center led the effort at WashU to become part of the Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Network, which is committed to advancing the teaching of STEM disciplines in higher education. In 2011, the Center for Integrative Research on Cognition, Learning, and Education (CIRCLE) was funded by the Office of the Provost, and CIRCLE and the Center worked as close partners and collaborators on a number of projects. The Center increased the number and variety of programs it offered, including those centered on celebrating classroom diversity and promoting inclusive teaching practices. The Center provided technical support for Blackboard when it became the university\u2019s learning management system for courses. Expanding the Mission: 2018 \u2013 present Under the directorship of\u00a0 Michael Wysession (professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences), starting in 2018, the center broadened the reach of its programing beyond STEM to provide support to all schools and instructors at all levels. Workshops and programming now became available to\u00a0 instructors of all ranks and all academic disciplines, including a course design institute run at the start of each semester.\u00a0 Many workshops were targeted to meet the specific needs of discipline-specific groups such as the College Writing Program, the Brown School, ROTC program instructors, and the Center initiated several new programs now run annually such as the new faculty seminar series, a faculty reading community, and the Language Teaching Fair. In 2018, Classroom Services debuted the newly refurbished and redesigned high-tech active learning classroom in January 110 and began the annual process of transitioning, each year, a few traditional classroom spaces into more flexible active learning classrooms as part of their mission to equip WashU faculty and learners with the most pedagogically-informed teaching and learning spaces. Classroom Services also began to become more involved with digital classroom space, particularly through the recording of lectures into Kaltura, which would end up being very important with the arrival of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, the Teaching Center joined with the Learning Center to form the new Center for Teaching and Learning when the Cornerstone program was dissolved. The Learning Center first had its origins in the 1970s as part of Student Educational Services before joining with Disability Resources and the U.S. Dept. of Education TRIO program to form Cornerstone in 1990. The Learning Center\u00a0 provides mentoring to undergraduate students through programs such as Peer Led Team Learning (PLTL), Residential Peer Mentoring, and Academic Peer Mentoring, and provides much-needed student-centered perspective to CTL operations. The new Learning Center moved from the South 40 to the Mallinckrodt Center, working alongside other student-facing divisions such as the Writing Center and the First-Year College Writing Program. The Academic Services division was renamed Educational Development at this time to better reflect the scope of its work, and significantly reorganized its training and citation programs for graduate students and post-docs. During this time the CTL also created a more intentional approach to communications and outreach, establishing a larger social media response, creating a regular and more-established dialog with instructors, and entirely revising and restructuring its web pages. 2020: Responding to COVID-19 and Systemic Racism Protests In 2020, the academic world was upended with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the CTL rose to the occasion by playing a significant role in the university\u2019s pivot to various modes of online teaching and learning. At the same time, worldwide protests over systemic racism and police brutality prompted academia to alter many institutional practices, and the CTL was at the forefront of responses in support of justice, equality, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI). The CTL\u2019s response to COVID-19 was rapid and immense at all levels. The CTL leadership team occupied positions of leadership on multiple University committees that acted swiftly to establish policies and then carry out the implementation of changes to WashU\u2019s teaching and learning practices to allow the university to continue through the pandemic in remote, hyflex, and hybrid formats. Foremost of these was the appropriation of the IT Teaching & Learning committee to bring together key people from all of the schools and many other divisions to build the tools and training needed for the pivot to online, including an extensive set of informational web pages. All pooled classrooms were given A/V upgrades, with the installation of high-resolution cameras and high-quality ceiling array microphones in most rooms, and Classroom Services provided a large number of online and in-person training programs helping instructors learn how to use them. CS also turned a large number of classrooms into recording studios and helped large numbers of instructors pre-record asynchronous course lecture materials. A small army of undergraduate students were hired and trained to be camera operators in large classroom spaces such as auditoria. University-wide enterprise licenses were obtained for a large number of educational technology programs (Kaltura, Poll Everywhere, Piazza, Hypothesis, Padlet, Apporto, etc.), and the CTL carried out a vast number of training sessions for instructors on how to teach in a virtual classroom. As online teaching was largely non-existent for most of the WashU campus pre-COVID, there was a steep learning curve for instructors as well as the CTL, but the transition to remote, hyflex, and hybrid modes of teaching went remarkably smoothly according to faculty surveys carried out in fall of 2020 and spring of 2021. The newly reconstructed Educational Development group at the CTL created a high-quality online two-week Course Design Institute that was presented repeatedly in 2020 and 2021, providing instructors with pedagogical training as well as the practical tools for teaching in various remote modalities. The Educational Development group also introduced a new program format called \u201cVirtual Conversations,\u201d which were taken by thousands of faculty. These 30-minute virtual conversations covered a wide variety of topics and helped WashU faculty efficiently and effectively adapt to the changing demands of the initial COVID-19 outbreak and the following Delta Variant. The Learning Center revised its entire structure to move all of its mentoring programs into virtual formats. Undergraduate mentors used a variety of digital tools such as personal document cameras and tablets to move mentoring sessions online. The CTL increased its programming in JEDI topics for instructors during 2020-2021, and worked with the Gephardt Center to create a program for helping faculty to adapt their courses to effectively address issues of systemic racism and colonialism.

Academic Programs Resources Our Mentors Contact the Learning Center Upcoming Mentor Sessions Resources News Contact Consultation Confidential Consultations & Observations We would love to chat with you about your teaching! Consultations The Center for Teaching and Learning\u2019s team of Educational Developers offer confidential consultations on teaching-related topics to all faculty, staff, graduate students, and postdocs affiliated with Washington University in St. Louis. We are happy to do individual and group consultations on any topic related to teaching. In-person or virtual consultations routinely cover topics such as: Troubleshooting classroom challenges Designing courses and course materials (e.g. syllabi, assignments, grading criteria, Canvas course pages, etc.) Strategies for engaging students and promoting classroom participation Using technology effectively in your teaching Developing accessible course content and materials aligned with the principles of Universal Design for Learning Teaching-related job market materials The Center for Teaching and Learning Professional Development in Teaching Program Observations and Feedback on Teaching We believe that good teaching is reflective teaching. A teaching observation can help facilitate this critical process of reflection. The Center for Teaching and Learning\u2019s Educational Development staff conducts observations of teaching via video-recording, in-class, or live Zoom observations for instructors looking for a confidential, outside perspective on the teaching and learning in their classroom. Generally, staff discusses the class with the instructor prior to the observation to gain understanding about how feedback might be tailored and to understand the unique challenges and opportunities related to teaching and learning in that particular instance. Frequent areas of focus for observations include but are not limited to: Classroom Management, Clarity and Organization of Content, Presentation Skills, Use of Technology, Teaching Methods, and Inclusive Teaching. Following the observation, the instructor meets again with our staff to follow up and consider strengths and areas for growth visible during the session. A confidential observation document is written up after these meetings and shared directly with the instructor. If the CTL has recorded the session for the instructor, an MP4 recording of the class session will be made available to the instructor via WUSTLBox after the observation is completed. Note that all observations are conducted only at the behest of the instructor themselves.

Introduction to the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning Scholarship of Teaching and Learning (SoTL) is a field of study dedicated to systematic and reflective inquiry of the effects of one\u2019s teaching practices on student learning. SoTL incorporates knowledge from educational and cognitive psychology research, and it leads to the dissemination of new knowledge. SoTL encourages faculty, graduate students, and postdocs to use their expertise as disciplinary scholars in their approaches to teaching. SoTL scholars explore and examine novel teaching strategies to continue the goal of improving student learning through focused inquiry, exploration of research, deliberate planning and implementation, and examination of collected data. Students who take the Introduction to SoTL seminar are able to work closely with Center for Teaching and Learning staff to further develop, implement, and analyze their SoTL projects.

Basic Room Equipment Troubleshooting My Picture is not displaying on the projection screen Ensure you have selected the proper source- Room PC for the computer in the cabinet, HDMI (picture of cable callout), VGA (picture callout), AirMedia (picture of screen callout) depending on the connection you are using for your laptop, or DVD, or Doc Cam.\u00a0 If using a laptop, ensure you have screen mirroring enabled.\u00a0 Also note that inexpensive non-OEM adapters do not always have sufficient bandwidth to work in a classroom environment- particularly when used with Apple laptops. I don\u2019t hear any sound Make sure the volume on the touch panel is not muted.\u00a0 Try increasing the volume level on the touch panel.\u00a0 If using the Room PC or a laptop, ensure the audio is not muted or set too low on the computer. I need to bring a presentation or other files in to use on the classroom computer We recommend that you save the file(s) to a cloud storage service (WashU officially supports WUSTL Box ) or a USB flash drive.\u00a0 USB ports are easily accessible on the front of the computer in the cabinet. The sound and/or video clips in my PowerPoint presentation are not playing While PowerPoint embeds images into the presentation, it does not embed sound clips or video clips. You must save your sound and video clips separately into the same directory as the presentation, and COPY THEM OVER with the presentation.

The Center for Teaching and Learning designs, manages, and supports several WashU classrooms that make collaborative learning among students and instructors effortless. These active learning classrooms (ALCs) include TechPod classrooms with cutting-edge technology as well as Roundtable and Flexspace classrooms that focus on student interaction. TechPod classrooms are designed to promote student collaboration with tables that seat students in pods with screen sharing via monitors situated at each pod. If your students will solve problems, review presentations, or work on digital materials/projects together, request one of our TechPod classrooms: January 110 , or Eads 016 . January 110 : Seats up to 60 students. Eads 016 : Seats up to 54 (ALC) or 125 (lab) students. Roundtable classrooms feature student pods in moveable tables, standard classroom technology, and whiteboards around the room, but do not have monitors at each pod. These classrooms are perfect for facilitating collaborative learning in smaller classes in which students regularly collaborate in small groups. Learn more about one of the following Roundtable rooms: McDonnell 361 , McDonnell 362 , Simon 017 , Simon 18 , Seigle 304 , Somers Family Hall 249 .

Research articles from prominent scholarly journals and higher education centers highlight the benefits of an ALC. Students who learn in an ALC have better attitudes, conceptual understanding, and passing rates. Research has shown that learning in an ALC also improves students\u2019 exam grades and satisfaction (Baepler 2016). In 2017, an EDUCAUSE Center for Analysis and Research report named ALCs its top strategic technology. ALCs at schools including Yale, MIT, University of Minnesota, and Washington University in St. Louis are largely modeled after SCALE-UP , a classroom designed at North Carolina State University in the mid-1990s to facilitate active learning. ALCs can be particularly useful in lecture courses. Researchers at the University of Minnesota looked at how ALCs impact student learning in large introductory biology courses. The same instructor taught the course in two rooms, an ALC and a traditional classroom, with the same course outline and pedagogical approaches. The research shows that ALCs positively affect student learning by improving student performance and engagement (Cotner 2013). Another study from researchers at Harvard University published in 2019 shows that even though students felt that they learned more from traditional lectures, they actually learn more when taking part in classrooms that employ active learning strategies. Active learning classrooms are a great conduit for employing these strategies. \u201cActive Learning Classrooms show how physical space can impact instruction in a positive way. When students face each other instead of the instructor they can interact much more easily. From an instructor\u2019s standpoint, it is more natural to incorporate student-centered activities into a class when the physical space allows for that flexibility,\u201d said Eric Fournier, Director of Educational Development at the Center for Teaching and Learning at Washington University in St. Louis. BILL LOWRY, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE \"January 110 has been a godsend for the Sustainability Exchange. We started doing this course in 2015 and for years we tried different venues, including the Academy Building. Once January 110 was open, we felt like we had a home. The room setup is perfect for our course. We typically have five or six project teams and each group uses one of the stations in the room. We use this format even when someone is leading a seminar and has the teams do exercises within the groups.\" Physical Space Physical space plays an important role in active learning classrooms. In A Guide to Teaching in the Active Learning Classroom by Baepler et. al. (2016), authors write that ALCs \u201ctypically feature round or curved tables with moveable seating that allow students to face each other and thus support small-group work. The tables are often paired with their own whiteboards for brainstorming and diagramming. Many tables are linked to large LCD displays so students can project their computer screens to the group, and the instructor can choose a table\u2019s work to share with the entire class.\u201d CLAIRE M. CLASS, POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW, DEPARTMENT OF ENGLISH \"The classroom in McDonnell 362 has new mini-whiteboards around the walls, which allow student groups to work through problems and share their work. These are extremely helpful teaching tools.\" ANTHONY J. SMITH, ASSISTANT DEAN & ACADEMIC COORDINATOR, COLLEGE OF ARTS & SCIENCES \"The room has been great. It worked out well for our \u2018Biology of Cancer\u2019 class. We have utilized the multiple whiteboards for student group activities and the mobile tables and chairs to move things around the room for whole-class activities and games. The multimedia capabilities worked well for various types of lecture presentations.

Academic Programs Resources Our Mentors Contact the Learning Center Upcoming Mentor Sessions Resources News Contact Designing Classrooms for Current & Future Learners Classroom Design Building learning environments that help you achieve success in your teaching. Design Standards for University-Managed Classrooms The Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) has developed a series of consistent, yet flexible design standards for the selection and placement of all classroom components. The standards are customized to fit the needs of the major department(s) in the building to the extent possible within budget limitations. Decisions to add technology to a classroom are made based on campus needs, the extent and feasibility of renovation required, and available funding. The CTL assesses campus needs for classroom technology by analyzing data gathered by the Office of the University Registrar. Design standards for classroom technology include the following: All technology installed in University-managed classrooms shall be easy to set up and easy to control by any individual with a minimum of training AV equipment shall be standardized across University-managed classrooms, ensuring that faculty can easily transition between rooms without additional training University-managed classrooms shall be equipped with, at minimum, a Room PC with DVD playback capability, at least two options for laptop connectivity, a data projector, access to the University network, and simple touch panel AV control. Each University-managed classroom shall contain an instructor\u2019s desk or podium specially designed to facilitate the use of the latest instructional technology while ensuring the technology is not intrusive to faculty who prefer more traditional teaching methods. The desk or podium shall be custom-built to best meet the teaching needs of the major department(s) using the room, to fit into the room, and to match the room d\u00e9cor. To view descriptions, photographs, and specific equipment located in a classroom, please see the Classroom Directory .

Academic Programs Resources Our Mentors Contact the Learning Center Upcoming Mentor Sessions Resources News Contact Class Recording While we have resumed full in person classes, some departments may elect to continue to record class sessions for purposes such as material review and make-up.\u00a0 This decision is up to the individual faculty member and the department.\u00a0 At the department\u2019s discretion, the CTL will provide a student worker to handle camera movement for a small fee. This camera movement, particularly useful in auditoriums, can be customized to the faculty member\u2019s preference- following the instructor, focusing on board work, focusing on projected images, or a combination. To ensure the recordings properly integrate with the Canvas course, the instructor will need to set up the Zoom or Kaltura recording for his or her class(es) in advance.\u00a0 The student worker is responsible for adjusting the camera based on the instructor\u2019s stated preferences, as discussed above. The CTL is responsible for hiring, assigning, and managing the student workers. To ensure the department is not charged for unused hours, the faculty member should communicate with either the student worker or the scheduler, in the CTL, any days that the student will not be needed. Fee schedule : Typical 50 minute class:\u00a0 $35 per class session Typical 80 minute class:\u00a0 $47 per class session **Please note that this service is intended only for full-semester courses. Recordings for ad-hoc classes may be requested, provided that a minimum of two weeks\u2019 notice is provided. The event organizer will be responsible for setting up and starting the Zoom or Kaltura recording.** Please fill out the below form to request a student worker trained by the CTL to run the camera for your class.

I love getting to know a wide variety of students and helping them with all kinds of subjects. The help we provide as RPMs is unique as it comes from peers as opposed to professors or graduate student TAs, which often allows students to ask the questions that they might not want to ask someone in a more official position.

Academic Programs Resources Our Mentors Contact the Learning Center Upcoming Mentor Sessions Resources News Contact February 6, 2024 February 6, 2024 Teaching Tips Why Students Drop Classes in the First Week of the Semester Eric Fournier Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email New faculty are sometimes concerned about the number of students who drop their courses in the first week of a semester.\u00a0 It is hard not to take this personally\u2014especially if you are new to teaching.\u00a0 In an effort to better understand the issue, I asked a variety of faculty members about their experience with this challenge.\u00a0 Late semester drops are typically due to apprehension about a poor grade or sometimes due to a personal or family crisis.\u00a0 But, in this case, I am focusing on students who drop a class prior to the \u201cno penalty deadline\u201d at the beginning of the semester, or sometimes before a class even begins.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Reasons for this are as varied as students themselves, but there seem to be a few common elements. Students sometimes \u201ccourse shop\u201d by enrolling for more credits than they need (and might even register for two classes that meet on the day day/time). They attend the classes and then decide (often based on the information they get at the first class meeting) whether to continue. Deciding factors could include: perceived difficulty, volume of work required, persona of the instructor, and relevance to career and personal interests. Students in elective classes are more likely to course shop. Required classes tend to have very low drop rates, while elective classes might see drop rates of 15-20%. Newer instructors have not established a reputation among students, and students may not feel drawn to a newer instructor due to that perceived uncertainty. Some popular courses have capacity limitations. Students will enroll in extra courses until they know if they will/won\u2019t be able to join a high demand course.\u00a0 Opening extra seats in one course can sometimes create a domino effect as students drop their back-up classes and enroll in the high-demand course. Flexible programs, where students have an array of options to meet their degree requirements, tend to have higher drop rates than less flexible programs where options are more limited. Multiple-section classes that are scheduled either early or late in the day tend to have higher drop rates as many students prefer mid-day meeting times. Students will sometimes join a waiting list and if they eventually get in, might end up dropping the course because of other commitments. Less systemic issues can be summarized by student quotes: \u201cI signed up for two courses at the same time and visited each to see which one I liked best.\u201d \u201cMy friend was in another class, so I decided to take that one.\u201d \u201cSeigle Hall is too far from McKelvey and I can\u2019t make it there in the ten minutes we\u2019ve got between classes.\u201d \u201cMy work schedule changed and I can\u2019t take a late afternoon class.\u201d \u201cI changed majors and don\u2019t need this class anymore.\u201d Suggestions for reducing early-semester drop rates: Make sure your Canvas-based materials are well organized and provide a thorough overview of the course. Canvas-scanning is one way that students course shop, and a poorly designed Canvas course or one with lots of missing information sends a negative impression. Send a welcome message to students prior to the first class meeting to help clarify expectations and to share your enthusiasm for the course. Some instructors record a welcome message on Canvas. Have your assessment plan worked out and ready to share on the first day of class (or sooner). This will help answer student\u2019s questions about the volume of work, perceived difficulty and relevance to their personal and career interests. Make the first day of class count! The first class meeting provides a unique opportunity to engage students. First-day activities can create a welcoming, inclusive classroom environment that will boost student\u2019s sense of belonging and enhance their learning experience throughout the semester.\u00a0 James Lang offers four key principles for the first day of class. Experienced faculty and administrators note that early semester drops or churn (where the course roster fluctuates a lot in the first few days) is rarely the fault of an individual instructor, and is most often a reflection of some combination of the factors listed above.\u00a0 Those first turbulent weeks of a semester can sometimes shake a new faculty member\u2019s confidence, but it is important to focus on the things you can control: course design, the first class meeting, creating an online presence, and demonstrating that you are invested in your student\u2019s success.

The impetus for this project has been the growing sense that a campus-wide effort is required to effectively promote student well-being rather than seeing this issue as solely the responsibility of student health services (Okanagan Charter, 2015). While support services play a vital role in assisting students, instructors\u2019 decisions about course design and policies can also have a major impact on student mental health, which is of rising concern at WashU and across the United States. Nationally in 2019, 40% of students at colleges and universities reported having a significant mental health problem (Eisenberg et al., 2019). Here at Wash U, students have reported that stress, anxiety, depression, and sleep difficulties are among the top factors negatively impacting their academics (ACHA-NCHA III, 2020). For example, 38% of students said that stress significantly affected their performance (ACHA-NCHA III, 2020). The guidebook offers a variety of evidence-based strategies and resources for instructors to choose from. There are ideas to use in course design, in developing your syllabus, in the first weeks of class, and throughout the semester. \u201cMany suggestions in this resource apply across disciplines and can be adapted for any level of student,\u201d says Eric Fournier, PhD, Director of Educational Development in the Center for Teaching & Learning, \u201cMost are modest interventions that take little effort to implement yet can have a large impact on the overall well-being of WashU students.\u201d The strategies and resources in the guidebook are centered around four keys to well-being: Social Connection : Build a welcoming environment by creating opportunities for connection with you and their peers. Compassion and Stress Reduction : Actively listen to your students, acknowledge their perspectives, and use course policies and teaching practices that help reduce stress. Belonging and Growth Mindset : Show students that mistakes are part of the learning process and help them work through challenges in a way that encourages self-compassion and promotes a sense of belonging. Gratitude and Purpose : Help students appreciate positive experiences and explore links between their coursework and their sense of purpose in life. Using this guidebook, instructors can do their part to support students in achieving a positive sense of well-being at WashU. It may also help them think of ways to prioritize their own well-being. \u201cAs a community, we can all benefit from prioritizing well-being,\u201d says Cheri LeBlanc, MD, the Executive Director of the Habif Health & Wellness Center. \u201cI encourage faculty to take full advantage of this guidebook. It is an excellent tool you can use to sharpen your focus on students\u2019 well-being and, in turn, improve their performance at WashU and throughout life.\u201d In addition to providing strategies for supporting student well-being in classes, the guidebook also offers suggestions for handling situations where a student may be experiencing psychological distress , including how to talk with students and refer them to mental health resources on campus. The CTL will facilitate workshops throughout the semester to support instructors in learning more about strategies from the guidebook.

Academic Programs Resources Our Mentors Contact the Learning Center Upcoming Mentor Sessions Resources News Contact Teaching Resources Generative AI and Teaching Resource Overview Information about GenAI tools and their implications for teaching and learning What is Generative AI (GenAI)? Generative AI (GenAI) refers to a host of tools that can generate new content such as text, images, or audio. These tools are trained on large amounts of data and can perform many tasks much faster than could be done manually by a real person. Generative AI composition tools, in particular, can write convincing text on nearly any topic and even have conversations that mimic human interaction. While GenAI itself is not new, it became much more widely used with the public release of new versions of improved composition tools in 2023, such as ChatGPT. The ability to quickly and easily generate relatively high-quality text and images raises a number of concerns. Faculty at WashU and other institutions have wondered how GenAI will impact teaching and learning. On one hand, GenAI creates new possibilities to support student learning through things like interactive learning tools, self-quizzes, and help with brainstorming, among others. On the other hand, many instructors worry about the integrity of take-home exams and essays, the future utility of homework, and if GenAI will discourage students from learning the fundamentals of a topic if they can simply ask chatbot for an answer. However as GenAI is not going to go away, instructors will likely need to adapt their courses to both make use of GenAI (when appropriate) and to respond to any challenges that AI may present to traditional models of teaching and learning. Recommendations for GenAI and Teaching Adapting your courses to the new AI landscape can feel daunting. While there is no single correct approach to do so, we hope that the following steps will help you make the pedagogical decisions that are right for you and your students. Learn about GenAI and its capabilities firsthand Reflect on the role of GenAI in your courses and discipline Consider ways that GenAI may enhance student learning Consider ways that GenAI may detract from student learning Reflect on the ethics of AI use and avoidance Be transparent about the role of AI in your course and clear about your AI policies 1. Learn about GenAI and its capabilities firsthand The best way to understand GenAI\u2019s capabilities and limits is to try it out yourself. Experiment with some of the major AI tools that generate text and images. Compare the text results to the Washington University versions of ChatGPT Beta and Microsoft Copilot . Learn the basics of effective prompt writing to really understand what GenAI can do. See how GenAI responds to your course assignments. And check back occasionally as AI capabilities and the AI landscape are changing quickly. 2. Reflect on the role of GenAI in your courses and discipline The impact of generative AI varies across disciplines and across courses within disciplines. Some fields may expect graduates to use AI daily , while other fields may take a much more cautious approach. When confronted with any potentially disruptive situation in teaching and learning, we recommend returning to your students\u2019 learning goals and the principles of backwards design . What should students know or be able to do after taking your course? How will you and your students know if they have achieved those goals? How will you help them reach those goals? Focusing on these kinds of fundamental questions can help you make informed decisions about the appropriate role of GenAI in your course. 3. Consider ways that GenAI may enhance student learning Students\u2019 progress towards some learning goals may be helped by incorporating GenAI into your teaching and assignments.\u00a0 For example, GenAI tools like ChatGPT can be added into assignments or you can use AI to generate examples and exercises to use in class. Faculty from many institutions have used GenAI in their courses in creative ways. We encourage you to investigate ideas and resources for using AI within your teaching and assignments. One place to start is the book Teaching with AI : A Practical Guide to a New Era of Human Learning which contains many creative ideas for using AI as an instructor ( available as an ebook from WashU libraries ). Another is WashU\u2019s new Generative AI Teaching Activities: Online Repository . 4. Consider ways that GenAI may detract from student learning Sometimes students must first learn the basics of a field in order to achieve long-term success, even if they might later use shortcuts when working on more advanced material. We still teach basic mathematics to children, for example, even though as adults we all have access to a calculator on our smartphones. GenAI can also produce false results (aka \u201c hallucinations \u201d) and often only a user who understands the fundamental concepts at play can recognize this when it happens. Finally, sometimes the end product students produce isn\u2019t even the focus in education per se. Many writing assignments, for example, are much more about learning how to think and to make arguments than about simply creating a block of text on a particular topic. Like a runner training for a marathon, the point isn\u2019t to just get from point A to point B, but to transform oneself along the way. A car might be faster, but it won\u2019t build the muscle and endurance we seek. In these cases, it may make sense to adopt some teaching strategies that avoid AI and assignments that are more AI resistant. In these cases, investigate ideas and resources for AI resistant teaching and assignments . 5. Reflect on the ethics of AI use and avoidance There are many unresolved ethical questions surrounding GenAI and its use. For example, the results of GenAI often display the biases of their training data, the use of AI may have an environmental impact , there are unresolved questions related to intellectual property and AI models, not everyone has equal access to all AI tools and robust AI literacy, and AI citation practices can be extremely murky. At the same time, some have also argued that we would actually be doing our students a disservice not to train them to use GenAI, especially as it seems some fields may expect our students to use it upon graduation. All of these issues are complex and unlikely to be resolved soon, but are important to consider as you make decisions about the use of AI in your courses. 6. Be transparent about the role of AI in your course and clear about your AI policies Be explicit in your course about when/how students can or cannot use AI tools and your reasons for making those decisions. Different instructors will have different expectations in regards to GenAI, so being clear about your expectations for your course is critical. For assignments, identify skills that are crucial for your students to practice and those that are less crucial and would benefit from AI support. There is a broad spectrum of ways students and AI could contribute to an assignment. Let your students know what is acceptable in your course by adding a short statement to your syllabus explaining your GenAI course policies . For more ideas, see these example tables for more potential spectrums of AI-Student Collaboration that you can copy/use in your class. For example, boundaries can vary across assignments and across language classes. At the intro level, students may need to practice grammar, so students must proofread on their own for each assignment. For other classes, proofreading and getting feedback from AI may be acceptable, but writing the core arguments and content may not be. For other course, AI could be used to generate possible ideas that students then curate, build on, revise, or synthesize.

Academic Programs Resources Our Mentors Contact the Learning Center Upcoming Mentor Sessions Resources News Contact Teaching Resources Language for Course Policies on Artificial Intelligence (AI) Resource Overview Examples of language to use in your syllabus to communicate to students the permitted uses of AI in your course Overview Regardless of your course policies for generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), it\u2019s important to clearly communicate those policies with students through the course syllabus and to reiterate the policies, where relevant, within individual assignment guidelines. It is also advisable to explain to students why you are implementing those policies so that they can better understand how the use or avoidance of GenAI will advance their learning. There are many possible approaches to policies on the use of GenAI in a course. Your policies can also vary within a course by assignment or assignment type (e.g. GenAI is allowed without restriction for some assignments while on others it is prohibited). The sections below describe potential policy types and offer examples of syllabus language for each type. If your policies vary by assignment, be sure to clarify that on the syllabus. AI Usage Level Description Example Allowed Without Restriction: GenAI can be used for any and all coursework Students are encouraged or expected to use GenAI tools to help foster AI literacy Allowed With Citations: GenAI can be used freely, but only with appropriate attribution Students can use GenAI tools to help with a writing assignment, provided that they follow APA guidelines for in-text citations and references page Restricted Partially: Specific GenAI tools are allowed, or GenAI is allowed under certain circumstances Image-based GenAI tools like Stable Diffusion are allowed for generating images for a project, but all text must be written by the student without the use of GenAI Restricted Completely: All assignments should be written without the use or assistance of GenAI GenAI use in all circumstances is a violation of academic integrity Allowed without Restriction You may decide that the use of GenAI in your course in any circumstance will promote student learning and that students are free to use whatever GenAI tools they wish in the course, without restriction. Example syllabus language: You are encouraged to freely use GenAI tools in this class. In fact, some assignments may require it. When you use GenAI, no citation is required. However, keep in mind that GenAI is often limited in the scope and quality of its responses. You will likely need to enter multiple, refined prompts to ensure high quality content. In addition, you should always review and, where necessary, revise AI-generated responses for clarity, concision, accuracy, specificity, and appropriateness. Finally, keep in mind that GenAI tools are not bias-free. As with humans, GenAI can reproduce harmful prejudices and omit important perspectives. It is your responsibility to use GenAI to augment your own critical thinking processes, not to replace them. Allowed with Citation You may decide that he use of GenAI in your course in any circumstance will promote student learning, but that you want students to acknowledge their use of GenAI with appropriate citations. Example syllabus language: GenAI literacy is quickly becoming an important professional skill. As such, you are allowed to use GenAI tools in this class as long as you provide proper citations for those tools. Before our first writing assignment, we\u2019ll spend class time discussing both the ethical implications and strategic considerations of using GenAI tools. Remember that AI-produced content is essentially crowd-sourced information\u2014it is your responsibility as a researcher to assess and evaluate the provided information to determine its credibility and accuracy. Use the information the tool provides to conduct your own further research into the issues. Whenever you use an AI tool to assist you, you should cite it. Please follow the appropriate citation guidelines for citing GenAI tools in MLA, APA, Chicago, and Turabian Style. In addition, GenAI does not always produce responses appropriate for every assignment. You will likely need to use GenAI as a starting point, providing further revisions, expansions, or clarifications in order to meet assignment requirements. Ultimately, you are the final author of any compositions you put forth in this class and are accountable for their accuracy, credibility, and rhetorical usages. Restricted Partially You may decide that GenAI can be used on certain assignments or for certain activities, but not others. For example, you might allow the use of GenAI in your course to generate ideas or make corrections in grammar, but you might not want students to entirely replace their own writing with AI generated content. In other cases, you might have a course where the use of GenAI is completely unrestricted on some assignments, but the other assignments or exams should be completed without the use of any AI tools. Example syllabus language: GenAI tools are exciting and useful, in certain circumstances. Most of these tools are based on large language models, which means that they give us access to an incredible amount of information in a very short amount of time. However, because these tools are based on a wealth of uncited information from all over the internet that, in many cases, has not been validated or peer-reviewed, these tools can also generate information that is factually incorrect, ethically problematic, or even harmful, especially when that information is consumed and shared without any kind of critical analysis. Outside of the guidelines provided below, I consider the submission of any work that has been created in whole or in part by GenAI tools to be a violation of academic integrity, unless you have obtained prior approval or guidance from me. Acceptable Use of GenAI: Using tools (like Microsoft Word\u2019s Spell Check, Grammarly, or ChatGPT) to provide minor, localized suggestions on correcting the grammar, style, or organization of a paper you wrote yourself. (However, before you submit any of your own writing to one of these tools, I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the possible privacy concerns these actions might entail.) Using tools to help you with the brainstorming stage of writing. For example, if you\u2019re trying to figure out a topic for a paper, asking ChatGPT \u201cwhat are some major issues related to environmental sustainability?\u201d would be acceptable usage. Unacceptable Use of AI: Using tools to write entire sentences, paragraphs, drafts, or papers to complete class assignments, whether or not you claim that writing as your own or cite it as having come from a tool. Using tools to provide your citations or citing tools as a source of information themselves. For example, it\u2019s acceptable to cite ChatGPT as a source for an assignment if you used it to help you brainstorm; however, it would be unacceptable to refer to information provided by ChatGPT as a source itself. Much like guidelines you have probably received on the use of Wikipedia, you can use these tools as a starting point, but you need to verify the information they give you and cite other sources that corroborate that information instead. Restricted Completely You may decide that the use of GenAI in any way would not support student learning and/or that the ethical issues of GenAI use outweigh its advantages. Example syllabus language: It is vital to learn the fundamental concepts of our field without using outside aids before moving to more advanced material. Part of that learning process involves struggling on your own with difficult material without any help from GenAI. In addition, work produced by GenAI reuses information and language from external sources without citation and thus the submission of any work created in whole or in part by GenAI tools cannot be considered to be original in our course setting. I therefore ask that you do not make use of any GenAI to help complete any work in this course. The use of GenAI in this course will be considered an academic integrity violation and would be referred to the university academic integrity process. Violations could potentially result in grade penalties, such as a zero on the assignment, and/or other university-level sanctions.

Because of the prominence of the topic in the world of teaching and learning, I\u2019ve also had the chance to attend a range of talks, symposia, and other events about AI. Until very recently, however, I had mostly treated AI tools as sandboxes \u2013 I would try them out just enough so I could have a base-line familiarity with how to use them, but I didn\u2019t actually, well, use them for anything meaningful. Inspired by the Summer AI Institute organized by the Center for Teaching and Learning , I decided to give AI an actual whirl. I was particularly interested to see how AI would handle tasks related to the humanities, as those are the disciplines I am most intimately familiar with. A dozen app accounts and a few hours later, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m an expert but I do have some observations about the particularities of AI and the humanities. Peculiar particulars: Explaining terms I wanted to see how gen AI might do with explaining some Classics-related terms. I asked Bing Copilot \u2013 my favorite because it uses a higher-powered AI algorithm and provides links to its sources \u2013 the following: In the field of Classics, people seem to use the term \u201creception\u201d a lot. What do they mean by it? The answer started out cogent, accurate, and accessible to the non-specialist. It moved from a simple definition to some core assumptions (\u201cclassics have been interpreted from different ideological and political stances\u201d) and even the role of reception studies in the field (\u201cThis approach has invigorated classic studies\u201d). Toward the very end, though, things took an odd turn as the response dove deep into theory land: \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that reception theory originated in Hans Robert Jauss\u2019 argument for a paradigmatic change in the study of literary history, his plea for paying critical attention to the historicity of interpretation or what he called Rezeptions\u00e4sthetik, which in turn owes a great deal to Hans-Georg Gadamer\u2019s philosophical hermeneutics, particularly the concept of the \u2018fusion of horizons.\u2019\u201d A quick ctrl+F revealed that the final paragraph was lifted almost verbatim from an article by Zhang Longxi, published in the Journal of East-West Thought . Bing does add a footnote that leads to the article, but it doesn\u2019t distinguish between direct quotes and material that paraphrases a source. (In some cases, the footnotes seem to have no clear connection to Bing\u2019s output.) Verdict: Helpful and informative, but a weird combination of vaguely sign-posted summary and borderline plagiarism. Reading, fast and slow: Summarizing articles Next, I wanted to see how Bing would do in summarizing a scholarly article and generating potential reading questions. I was especially curious to see how gen AI would fare in extracting main arguments from humanistic scholarship that often isn\u2019t structured in as predictable a format as STEM articles tend to be. This lack of clear signposting, I find, often poses great challenges to undergraduate students. As such, I was wondering if gen AI could guide students in their reading. I picked \u201cAthenian Slave Names and Athenian Social History\u201d by Kostas Vlassopoulos, partly because I wanted to read the article and partly because it laid out its main arguments more clearly and explicitly than your average Classics article. (To non-humanists: a lack of clarity is not an insult, as humanities thrives on nuance and complexities.) I asked Bing to create questions students could consider before and while reading the article. Lesson one: Bing had no trouble accessing the text which is behind a paywall \u2013 one can hope Microsoft has a subscription! The \u201cbefore\u201d questions were adequate enough, as they aimed to invite student interest and hypothesizing. One example: \u201cHow do you think the study of slave names could contribute to our understanding of the role and function of slavery within Athenian society?\u201d The reading questions were similarly useful \u2013 slightly vague, but they could walk students through identifying the main arguments, evidence used, limitations of the study, etc. When I asked Bing to provide example answers, things got a bit weird. Like a student who\u2019s done half of the reading, the responses seemed feasible on the surface but were a mixture of generalities and outright lies. That the names of enslaved people reflect \u201ccultural and social dynamics of the time\u201d is true to be sure, but it doesn\u2019t capture Vlassopoulos\u2019 observation about how the names of citizens and enslaved people overlapped considerably, with ramifications for, for example, how easy it would have been to distinguish people\u2019s status. The answers mention pottery fragments as a source, but those aren\u2019t mentioned in the article. Guided by advice given in Teaching with AI , I decided to embrace roleplay and step into the role of a didact. I told Bing: These sample answers do not correctly reflect the content of the article. Take a moment to rethink and try answering them again based on the article. And lo and behold, the answers improved. The errors dropped off, and the responses were more specific. I still feel like I wandered into a disquieting uncanny valley when I told a machine to think more slowly and better, and it did , but there\u2019s no denying the technique worked. Verdict: Not very helpful, as it seems you need to check the answers for hallucinations. Good thoughts or joyless answers? Specialized summary app I also spent a bit of time dabbling in more specialized applications. Some seem more useful for STEM material \u2013 for example Explainpaper paraphrases any text you highlight, which I\u2019d imagine is most helpful for text that is full of science vocabulary. Humata, however, seemed potentially humanities-friendly \u2013 it even has a Zoroastrianism-inspired name (meaning \u201cgood thoughts,\u201d apparently)! As ridiculous as it may be, however, the app filled me with bad thoughts instead of good ones. The app is designed to quickly find answers from PDFs. It even highlights relevant parts of the text so you can (nominally) check where the app draws its information from. I uploaded the same article by Vlassopoulos. (I would apologize, but my Bing experiment showed AI sees all, so I can\u2019t muster too much guilt over feeding Humata one PDF.) Within seconds, the app spat out a competent summary of the article along with suggested questions I could ask the app. And these weren\u2019t vague \u201cWhat do you think we can learn from slave names?\u201d types of questions. Both the questions, and the answers I solicited from the app, were specific and detailed. The app is weirdly glitchy in that it highlights the wrong passages in the text, but the responses were all accurate and rooted in the actual article. And here I was, looking at a machine that could mean I never have to annotate text again, painstakingly type notes into Zotero, nor\u00a0skim through an article in search of the quote I swear I remember reading somewhere. Cue existential angst. Humata is efficient, adept, and completely removes the unique mixture of boredom, excitement, frustration, and joy that is seeing an argument unfold and take shape. It tells me the facts, but it removes the voice of the author and the shape of the argument. Verdict: Extremely helpful, utterly terrifying. Through outsourcing it, I\u2019m beginning to understand how much joy there is in the work. I\u2019ve seen some arguments about how letting AI design our course materials frees up more time for the \u201creal work\u201d of being in the classroom. But I enjoy designing courses: poking around online and flipping through books, collecting little tidbits that I might want to draw on during a lesson, envisioning what I\u2019d like to see.\u00a0With sophisticated enough prompts, AI can also skim research literature and identify the most relevant gems. But like many people in the humanities, I enjoy reading far and wide, whether each text\u00a0directly addresses exactly what I need or not. Arguments about how AI work will become the new \u201cC-level work\u201d terrify me because from what I\u2019ve seen, AI will soon provide arguments so eloquent and sophisticated that I won\u2019t be able to improve on them \u2013 and it certainly already spits them out faster than I do. And yet, I like using my brain, flawed as it may be.\u00a0Finally, I grieve the prospect of our students not having rich opportunities to do the work and find joy in it. In my conversations with students this coming year, I hope to move beyond concerns about academic integrity (which students seem quite concerned about) and instead talk with them about what is meaningful and, yes, joyful to them about learning.

Academic Programs Resources Our Mentors Contact the Learning Center Upcoming Mentor Sessions Resources News Contact July 9, 2024 July 9, 2024 Digital Pedagogies , Educational Technology Padlet as a Google Jamboard Alternative Eric Fournier Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email Google Jamboard was one of my favorite pandemic-era teaching discoveries. I loved how it employed a simple, easy-to-use, sticky note feature for brainstorming and sorting activities that was very similar to the kinds of things I did with in-person classes. I kept using it post-pandemic, for both classes and for faculty development workshops. Sadly, Google decided to eliminate Jamboard and it will not be available after December 31, 2024. While they recommend several alternatives including FigJam , Lucid , and Miro (and even offer tools to migrate saved Jamboards to the new platforms), I feel those tools are too complex for the simple activities I had developed via Jamboard. Thankfully, Padlet, a CTL-supported tool , has developed a template that provides a viable alternative to Jamboard, and as a bonus, can be fully integrated into existing Padlets. I discovered this via a LinkedIn post from author and faculty developer Tolu Noah . To access this new tool, log into your Padlet account (or make an account) and then click https://sandbox.new/ . Once this is added, you will see that the tools, including the sticky note feature, are easy to add. The tools are found on the right side of the Padlet and include: select, interact, pointer, draw, highlight, erase, rectangle, note, text, and attachment. Click on the tool and then on the Padlet to add a note. Notes can be duplicated by hovering over the bottom of the note and dragging it to a new position. Click on the bottom of the note to changes colors. Right click on a note for more options, including freeze, which fixes a note in place. Adding additional slides (they call them a canvas\u2014an unfortunate choice of terms given the ubiquity of the LMS of the same name) is easy with a + button. Various templates including columns, grids, Venn diagrams, and calendars can be employed by clicking the three dots to the right of the canvas button and then change background. In addition, one can add all of the features in a normal Padlet including text, media, and links. Sharing can be private or public and can be shared via invitation or link. Another nice feature are breakout links which generate a distinct link for each canvas and allows a group of users to collaborate in a single canvas without being able to see the other canvases. Padlet also has a tool to import existing Jamboards. Overall, this new feature in Padlet seems like a viable alternative to Google Jamboard.

I love getting to know a wide variety of students and helping them with all kinds of subjects. The help we provide as RPMs is unique as it comes from peers as opposed to professors or graduate student TAs, which often allows students to ask the questions that they might not want to ask someone in a more official position.

Each of the presentations and discussions will help students recognize challenge areas and learn new skills to bolster academic performance and foster self-growth and self-compassion. While these sessions are aimed to help anyone experiencing executive functioning challenges (EFCs) or those who identify as neurodivergent, all undergraduate students are welcome to attend. All sessions will be led by Dr. Jim Russell, who is a local certified psychological examiner with the Missouri Department of Elementary & Secondary Education (DESE), a National Certified Counselor, a member of the American Counseling Association, and a Diplomate & Clinical Mental Health Specialist with the American Mental Health Counseling Association. Dr. Russell is licensed to practice as a counselor in Missouri and has over 25 years of experience conducting psychoeducation evaluations for children, adolescents and adults. Dr. Russell also has a long-standing history with Washington University, where he taught a college success seminar for students with ADHD for many years. Find the schedule of events below. If you are interested in attending, please RSVP here so we can keep you posted about any date or location changes, send you reminder emails, and make sure we will have enough handouts for all participants. Organization Friday, October 11, 12 to 1:30 p.m. Mallinckrodt 305 Those with executive functioning challenges (EFCs) are more likely to struggle with organizational skills in time, task, and material management. These impairments may then lead to behaviors such as habitually running late, misplacing items, forgetting obligations, overspending, procrastinating, frequently jumping from one unfinished task to the next, and so much more. Learn how to identify your shortcomings, manage expectations, and take on new strategies to help. Procrastination Friday, October 18, 12 to 1:30 p.m. Mallinckrodt 305 Procrastination is the tendency to put off tasks, choices, and/or behaviors that either must be done as a part of daily life (like eating, or getting to bed at night), or when faced with a specific deadline (beginning a research paper, or studying for an upcoming final, for example). Find out why you may be procrastinating and how you can overcome this propensity. Task Initiation and Management Friday, October 25, 12 to 1:30 p.m. Mallinckrodt 305 Have you ever sat down to work, knowing you need to do it and may even want to, but find you just can\u2019t get started? Or, do you readily begin a new assignment and fizzle in your progress, leaving the last steps undone and feeling like you simply can\u2019t complete it? Learn what is happening at the neurobiological level and how you can improve your task management skills. Emotional Regulation Friday, November 1, 12 to 1:30 p.m. Mallinckrodt 305 Emotion regulation is the heart of emotional resilience; thus, students experiencing higher levels of emotion dysregulation typically display lower adaptability. Because the ability to \u201cbounce back\u201d helps college students cope with everyday academic and personal life stresses in a healthy way, students who struggle with emotional dysregulation are more likely to develop depression and anxiety and turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance abuse and avoidance, as well as experience heightened test anxiety, lower self-confidence, the inability to persevere in the face of hardship, and more. Come away from this session with new tools and strategies for building resilience. Announcements Back to Announcements Resources Interested in attending? RSVP here!

I love getting to know a wide variety of students and helping them with all kinds of subjects. The help we provide as RPMs is unique as it comes from peers as opposed to professors or graduate student TAs, which often allows students to ask the questions that they might not want to ask someone in a more official position.
